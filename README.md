# KBSApp
Course project for Knowledge Based Systems
Nowadays, because of the universality of smartphones, development and publishing of mobile apps in App Stores has boosted. But, this has also led to a drop in the quality of the published apps. Any smartphone user is aware that the quality of mobile apps greatly vary. This project intends to mine for such suspicious apps and use the inferred knowledge to determine whether an unseen app is prone to be buggy. More specifically, analyze the app permissions and user reviews to identify potential correlations between error-sensitive permissions and error-related reviews. Thus, this system can act as an efficient static checker to identify buggy apps before or after they are released in the App Stores.
