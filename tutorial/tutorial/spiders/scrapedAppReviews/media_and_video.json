Some people are calling the interface clumsy and I couldn't disagree more. There are a lot of settings sure but as someone that likes things to work in a very specific way, I wouldn't like the app if it were any different.   The stock Android music apps would constantly lose my place. Using this app's player podcasts now pick from where I left off every single time. It's so nice to not spend 7 minutes every car trip finding my place and hitting play.  The app is perfect. Please don't change a thing. If you must,  only rearrange what's there or add to it. Do not remove anything. I also appreciate the developer only asking for the bare minimum of permissions.  To the developer, great work and thank you.   Full Review   \n", "  I love this podcast app and listen to various podcasts with it several times a day, well worth it for this paid version. However over the last 10 days or so I've been having intermittent problems, podcasts just stop playing or what looked like one podcast playing is actually another and others getting corrupted. I do subscribe to a lot of podcasts though and there is a possibility of data corruption, either my fairly new micro sd card (not a fake one) or my phone, Moto G2 which is only a few months old.  Editing to add that it looks like the problem was with my phone (Moto G2 8gb) corruption memory cards as I've now been through two of them and need another new one. Without a memory card inserted there haven't been any more problems with garbled podcasts.  I am still having problems with playing podcasts stopping in the middle of playing and Podcast Addict quits but I also think that this is due to bad memory management on the Moto G2 as I also have it installed on my Nexus 7 v2 tablet and don't have any problems.  Sorry (to the developer) that I missed his reply asking for more details and only saw it when I came on here to update.

Odds are if you have a podcast it's on here. Really great interface, everything is nice, clean and very easy too find. Only gripe there is that the ads really bring the look down.

There are just too many issues for this app to be considered stable and too many features missing \"while we are working on them.\" There's also a problem with excessive contrast that can't be adjusted. Sure, you can underexpose and hope to restore detail in darker areas in post production. But for a \"state-of-the-arts\" app, that's unacceptable.

I'm using it on my Samsung S7 and there are several features that either don't work or are broken in some fashion or another. A few cases in point, I cannot control the mic audio gain at all. The slider moves up and down properly, but doesn't affect the audio feed whatsoever. Another is the focus lock. I can move the slider which will temporarily move the camera focus to that point, but then the camera immediately attempts to auto focus on something else within the frame. Even without the use of the slider, setting the app to lock the focus does nothing. The camera focus on whatever it feels is the main subject. Exposure is also somewhat broken. While I can manually set exposure and it does stay locked, moving the exposure reticle to different parts of the view does absolutely nothing. It's always using a weighted balance over the entire image. So, i have to full frame a section that has the correct exposure, then lock that level, and finally pull back to the scene I want to capture.

I bought the right easycap device off ebay, and had to buy a male to male rca cable as well. I kept getting \"signal lost\" every time I plugged my phone in. This is for two reasons. First, turn off the signal detection. Second, I had to change the settings: Startup device to UTV007 (iSTK1160 was the default), and video format to NTSC (PAL was default).   Other thoughts: Since it's the only app I've found that actually recognizes that a camera is plugged in, I suppose the price is worth it. There is some latency. It's to be expected though. Not too bad, you can probably use this as your main monitor if you wanted to be super cheap.  It would be nice if this could record, but there are screen recording apps that can be downloaded.

If this feature is added, I'll be happy to support the developers further by purchasing the Pro version.  Original review from 2014 (4 stars): I have a love-hate relationship with MX Player. It looks, works, and performs significantly better than the other half a dozen similar apps on my phone - yes, I do have 6 other players installed - but it comes up short in regards to playing certain video files. It is a pity - and it is often quite frustrating - that there is such a glaring issue, as I'd much rather use MX Player exclusively.
