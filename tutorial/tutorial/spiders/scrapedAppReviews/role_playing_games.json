[{"reviews": [" Be carefull rating this app low they retaliate against ppl who give bad reviews. This game overall 3 stars but I noticed if you give SCOPELY a bad review they will technically  give you a hard time at this game be very carefull, very money oriented,one upgrade at a time you no long er can sell old unused weapons for wood, we're once wood was easy now can't sell for stuff or anything for material. They design this game for buying customers only. They give you 3 star characters for token won, and now that's scarce as well, Very Very carefull buying coins some people don't get what they are promised and end up spending over hundreds of dollars on this app.   Full Review   \n", " Characters I tried for the Maggie today and pulled 11 3*s. With so many 4* and 5* I don't understand why you have to get so many 3*. So if anyone reads this don't waste your time keep your money or spend hundreds to get the characters you want.

It is a total scam. They even say oh double the chances. Yet there is no percentage of drop rate. I strongly feel that scoplay is being extremly greedy and scaming loyal players.

Full Review   \n", " Love the game even though it's a total rip off and misleading. The odds on winning any tournament / war etc are basically 0%  there is always the same top 5-10 factions winning everything with whole 5* teams . The people and factions who are not massively lucky in obtaining 5*s from spending great amounts of cash don't stand a chance in winning one. I suggest that they need to make it more fair by taken the top 10 factions/ rank 11-20 rank 21-30 aso... From all regions and put them all together. That way it's more of a fair game .

Been playing for almost three months now and i have no complaints with regards to the gameplay or the graphics.. it never freezes and loads very fast.

Edited 2nd April-  I've come to notice that it's nearly impossible to win the higher leveled missions and side quests the game offers. The minimum level of some of them are A++, and even S1 and beyond. But those levels are nearly impossible to win unless you have maxxed out 4 star and 5 star characters. It's rare to get those characters through free pulls, and leveling them above tier 3 is impossible without either winning or purchasing elite leveling gear.

{"reviews": ["  I originally gave this game 5 stars, but after playing to lvl 90 in 2 different servers, it really got bland.  First, after a server has been around for a good amount of time, you will end up with maybe 2 guilds, and way less than 100 active players. Which gets boring. Second, I started a new server because of that. Well there was a bug, and some players took advantage of it, and were basically removed from that server. In the end, it killed that server, I would say there were maybe 50 or less active players by the time I left. It was completely pointless. My problem is, they keep these servers going, so some noob might join a server, love the game, and actually spend money on runes, just to find out, it's a dead server. They need to merge servers when they get below a certain point, or it makes the game pointless.   Full Review   \n", " Update The update isn't allowing me to log in.

Great little dungeon crawler for your phone or even better for your tablet.  I only wish that they would release an extension.  I would buy it in a heartbeat.

I was looking for a game that played like the old Might & Magic (not Heroes) and Wizardry RPG's, and aside from having only one character to control, it was pretty darn close. My only complaint is that I wish the shop keeper was available more earlier in the game. You can get stuck without a key if they break quickly, which means backtracking a few levels. Good job though.

It's been a pleasure to play. Here's wishing u perfection with this gem of a game.   Full Review   \n", " Overall enjoyable so far I've only played a short bit, but it seems like a competent dungeon crawler. My only complaints are 1) the fog isn't on your mini-map, which makes it hard to tell where you've been without constantly opening your full map. 2) There are no icons on said maps to indicate where doors or items are, making it easy to forget to go back and explore while collecting goodies along the way. 3) This is more of a nitpick, but it'd be nice if there was a scrollbar to indicate your inventory is more than five slots.

The graphics are nice and nostalgic, and I dig the music. I really dislike the controls. Ranged combat is tough because it can be hard to aim at an opponent far away.

The characters have character, they're written as you would expect them to speak, and there is partial voicing of the dialogue in the most important places.  I have only played through the first world and a little into the second so far, and there has already been a decent amount of referencing to the show that could be considered spoilers.

You also still have not bothered to respond to bug reports, or fixed the forums so new players can actually post when your Player Support wont accept emails.   The game itself is better than this.

Sector Battles: -2 Competing directly against people who have been around so long they have literally every item in the game, is hard.  But to get the advertised Force abilities or Lightsaber you WILL have to compete for event crystals.  Even then, it will take months.

The game has everything I looked for organization, beautiful graphics, balanced gameplay (except where the story missions are always a level above you and you can't get instantly to that certain level please fix that I know its a marketing strategy but I just hate that)  and its just wonderful and um one more thing I use to play Spirit Lords and this is a total copy I know its by the same maker but you guys need more creativity otherwise Its great.   Full Review   \n", " Update: Was a good little game... Deleting after giving devs time to fix the mess they'd made. Upon the last update, the devs were inundated with serious gameplay issues. Apparently no beta testing used before imposing a game-play  ruining update.

Levels force you to farm more difficult missions before you have upgraded gear to reliably farm previous ones. Also... competative reward system eliminates you if you arent on a good device, before you even try.... the storyline is very giod though. Pretty much the only reason i still put up with the above and slow load times. Those are the worst of any game i have played   Full Review   \n", " Typical carrot on a stick Simple progression grinder, nothing special but an adequate time killer. Just do not spend any real money on it, outrageous prices for scant reward, they are essentially pushing pixelated heroin for junkies, relying on impulse buying. Just accept you will not get any where fast in this obvious cash cow and be patient. When South Park did the freemium gaming bit, they were satirising games like this, so fair warning. The controls in this game are really poor, often taps not registering or the character not going to the designated point. That is really the only difficulty i've found in this game, fighting the controls is what makes the game any challenge, and this is not how it should be. The challenge should come from well designed content.   Full Review   \n", " Weak and Oversized Gameplay is obnoxious & convoluted. Story drones on without any plot in sight. Visually mediocre.

It gets extremely repetitive after you hit lvl50 with your hunter, which is, by the way, the max level for your hunter when your guardians can hit lvl60... (Has nobody noticed that at nhn ? Or are you all just lazy ?) To sum it up, the game goes from dungeon crawling to exp & rune (what you need to evolve your guardians) farming and then, level 50, it's just plain zombie (exp material for your guardians) farming and occasional boss fights...   Another annoying point is the bad level of English that is written all over the app, let me get you an example:  \"freeze souls appears near philly and heavily damages for 10 seconds\"  Another example is the developers too stupid to double check their texts for typos, it's been since the daily missions update (1 month or so) that the \"arean\" typo hasn't been corrected.  On the bright side, for a free to play, the paying elements aren't too invasive even though the prices are ridiculous, and don't really block you from getting sick guardians, even though luck has the biggest role here.   In conclusion, not a bad game, but the developing team behind it really needs to step up their game and give it a real fresh breath   Full Review   \n", "  It's an okay game for it's genre. I've played a number of them in search for one that doesn't become a boring grindfest. But this isn't it unfortunately, as after awhile it does become a grindfest. The AI won't be able to clear anything on it's own, even stages ten levels below it's own level.   And on the subject of AI is the Guardians seem have a bug, I like to believe it's a bug, where they won't attack the enemy and just follow you around even though the enemy is right there and is chasing you. I play primarily as a sorceress, so ranged combat. Happened to me in a boss raid and on stage play.   And then there is the arena/coliseum, which is straight up autoplay with little control from you beyond pick teams and poking their portraits. While yes I use autoplay, it can get really dull watching idiot AIs fight..I know their health is suppose to compensate for their simplistic AI. Maybe I got use to my other game that is also a grind but the AI clears it pretty quick (faster if it's a lower stage) as the AI isn't as stupid and can clear things on their own.
