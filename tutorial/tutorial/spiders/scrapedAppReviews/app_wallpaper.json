It is also worth noting that you can set an automatic timer for a background switch, which is nice if you like variety. The battery-saving options are a bit lackluster and I wish there was a way to preview how the galaxies look (the Alien Shapes live wallpaper did that perfectly).

The setup couldn't be easier or quicker, you don't end up killing you're RAM cause you had to install a launcher too just to get the wallpaper, and the design truly brings to life the capabilities of your screen; the same capabilities you paid that extra $100 for when you bought your device so as to have the truer image, but have yet to witness the difference and therefore the value in buying the more equipped device.

One critique is the dearth of stats available and a better roto/fantasy section. Probable pitchers?

Completely frustrating, blackouts are a joke!   Full Review   \n", " At Bat 2016 update is terrible The 2016 update has rendered this app useless for my Android devices. Support is also terrible. Not supported for Samsung Galaxy Tab S? Seriously? I can watch some of a game and then it will continously freeze so often that I give up watching in frustration. It won't work on my Xperia Z2 either. The list of android tablets supported is about 2 long. Ridiculous. It doesn't work either on cellular connection or via WiFi. I can only use it on my PC by leaving it out of full screen mode. I've reverted back to the old player which is thankfully still available. But I mainly bought my subscription to watch it while travelling to and from work. So I have pretty much wasted the $150 I paid. Given the support I have received via email it is obvious MLB cares nothing for its customers. Oh yes and did I mention that watching a game now uses so much data that I can only watch a handful of games a month where before the update during spring training I was watching 5 games or more a week. 60 fps is nice but I would rather be able to watch more games.
