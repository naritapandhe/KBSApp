Scroll through the settings, add count down 30 seconds (gives you time to put the phone away), sync your music, change the interval updates to .5 miles, add your sneakers etc....

STILL Wish there was an easier way to search for friends. Putting in someone's full name, not having them come up, and having to scroll through all with the same first name only is tedious. Also wish there was a way to edit the shoes you add. Runs seem to be dropped for no reason right in the middle of a route.  adding mile splits would significantly improve this.

Full Review   \n", "  I  feel this app sets itself apart from other fitness apps because you can look at other people's routes if you are out of town. I have been on some really awesome runs away from home because of other people using this app. Runs through beautiful, downtown Washington DC across the Potomac at sunrise. Chicago, Orlando, beaches along the East coast and many more places in the west. You can set up routes and compete with other runners' times. It sets you up for motivating challenges that are sponsored by companies that have a special interest in runners.I don't have to be training for an upcoming race to stay motivated to run. At the end of the week it tells me how I did that week. At the end of the month it tells me how I did that month.

Amazing variety of exercises to choose from, and the timer pausing when I stop moving during a run (dog has to poop!) makes me feel like I get more accurate time for my splits than FitBit gives.   Full Review   \n", " Useful I use this quite a bit when I walk or jog. I find that it's easy to use in the continuous mode but can be very frustrating if you use the auto pause feature due to multiple repeated pauses if pace or direction changes. Overall, a handy tool for tracking workouts. No I would use the actual distance and calorie measurements as guidelines rather than exact data.   Full Review   \n", " Amazing! I've been using this for years now and I love it! It helps when u have someone in your running bracket to compete with. Example I'm in Texas and my friend is in California and we always compete with distance and time!

Full Review   \n", " Like it a lot I've used it just once but I did check out a bunch of apps. So I think this will be a winner. My only wish is that this app have a timer so I can do my splits without using another app. Let me know if I am missing something. Otherwise, it's a winner!   Full Review   \n", " Too many stupid features that don't work This app has way too many features that don't work. Gps is inconsistent, the auto pause just stops and doesn't resume AND the coaching feed cuts into your music with a really tiny voice that you can't hear above a mumble which screws up your whole rhythm. You can turn it off in settings but why this is auto set on is beyond me, no one wants their running rythem interrupted. EVER!  Perhaps it works better with a smart watch but that shouldn't be mandatory as it's not marketed specifically for a smart watch.   Full Review   \n", " Almost excellent I use most of the features and they work great, with one small but important exception.  The daily intake totals screen is buggy, and has been since I originally downloaded the app on my first phone over 3 years ago.

I was amazed at how well this app works. It also tracks where you are and where you've been. This was amazing. And if I get lost for some reason, I can follow my path back to where I started since it tracks my location. I give this app 5 stars because it is simply amazing.   Full Review   \n", "  I really love the app because I can map out my linger distances before starting them or finding other routes in the area. The only criticism I would give is when the women announces the mileage or directions for it to be louder. It pauses my music to announce it but I can barely hear her. If it's worry on people not liking it too loud have a volume button for her.   Full Review   \n", " Map my run is my running partner This app keeps my pace in check.

You can check out your history for over a year and you get weekly, monthly, and annual updates as well as occasional \"fitness flashbacks\" for special achievements, all with the free app. I do think the workout types available have been reduced. Just lately I've been having difficulty with the app pausing and restarting in the middle of a walk. I'm attempting to uninstall and reinstall to see if that helps. Finally, I wish the logout was one easy step from your workout. You have to go back to a menu screen and go all the way to the bottom to find logout. Overall still terrific.  Walgreen's revamped their Balance Rewards for healthy choices and can link with devices and apps, including Map My Fitness that covers everything.

It's no better than an Excel spreadsheet since you have to do all the work yourself, AND it's glitchy. Even on the sites it allows imports from, the measurements were ALWAYS off, and I'd have to go in and manually fix all of them before saving.  Also sucks that for the Meal Planner you can only add recipes (that you've created yourself, OR imported), and not any of the items I spent hours stocking my pantry with.  The 'HELP' page leads to nothing, and I could find NO assistance anywhere and had to spend hours just figuring out stuff for myself, so have moved back to my old app.  This app has SO MUCH potential, but unfortunately it's not supported like it should be, help pages don't work, and there's no guidance; you just have to figure it out. Well, instead of spending anymore time on it (I think I put in 12 hours), my \"guidance\" tells me to just use something else.

I like that I am becoming aware of the calories I eat. Even if I'm over goal, it teaches you which foods are monopolizing your calorie budget.

So far I deleted all of my other weight loss apps and find this app the best. Very organized accurate and motivating.   Full Review   \n", " Ad placement on new update I know you guys need to make your money and I've been using your app since WAY back when you guys first came out and have enjoyed this app immensely, but your ad placement is getting out of hand. Placing an ad on the top of the log page is SO annoying and highly distracting. It also seems to re-load at a pretty constant rate which leads me to think it's using my data unnecessarily. Be creative with your ad placement and not look like you only care about us a revenue source.   Full Review   \n", " Ads / overpriced subscription I've been a user of this app for a long time. I understand the need to monetize, but it's starting to get a bit out of hand. Premium is too expensive, and now there are ads cluttering up the UI. Not a good move.   Full Review   \n", " Great app! It took a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it this is a great app! It is easy to use & a very effective weight loss tool. I'm already down 29 lbs.   Full Review   \n", "  My favorite health app!  It has been very useful to me and my health goals.  I love that you can make recipes that combines ingredients and divides it into servings, helping out the home-cook!  It has an extensive database, part of which is crowd-sourced.  Crowd-sourcing does have its downfalls (sometimes items are inaccurate), but this app compensates by allowing you to edit food details, for instance, after scanning a barcode.  Sometimes it lacks restaurant items, but you can enter a custom item (such as something you looked up on google) and that is good enough for me.  The custom options really make the app!  Besides those benefits, this is the one app I love updating.  The team actually writes what is being improved in the \"what's new\" section, making it seem like someone actually cares and is working on real problems.  The developers seem to actually listen to complaints and FIX the problems!  Keep up the good work guys!   Full Review   \n", " Better than MFP I definitely find the UI and UX better than MFP. Easier to use, more intuitive, better looking, less obtrusive ads and sponsored content. Only thing missing is Garmin connect communication! Definitely bump up to 5 stars with that functionality.

It makes it easy to add the calories onto my daily log. I also love that I could link my activity tracker to the app. It adds my calories earned from exercise. So great. Download it, you won't regret it. I am thinking that I might purchase the premium app based on how great the free version is.   Full Review   \n", "  After 3 attempts to resolve the problem...linking with Google Fit \"breaks\" the app.  You lose the ability to scan or manually search for foods to enter and the app locks up.  The developers are aware of this, but my last email response stated that they hadn't identified the \"glitch\" so they can't estimate when it will be resolved and to keep an eye on updates in the Google Play store.  As a paid subscriber that only paid for the sync ability, I'm not happy.  They extended my membership 2 months as compensation, but that was 2 months ago and the app is still not working.  If I have to use an app that won't sync with Google Fit I might as well go back to MyNetDiary since it has far superior Diabetes tracking and reporting.

Confused, it asked for my weight etc at the startup, once on the app it's telling me I weigh 13kg that's TWO stone so I need to eat 3000 calories a day. I entered the correct weight, it won't let me change it or I can't find an option to do so in all of the settings.

I tried LoseIt as it works with the Microsoft Band 2. However, LoseIt is a far chunkier UI (compared to Noom) and it's food item search is intolerably slow,  both with on line wifi and offline. On the plus side,  it's recipes are better, and it's integration with the Microsoft health service strong.

Soon as I downloaded I scanned several items in my kitchen...unfortunately it was incorrect on the calories on several items, and not by a small amount. Being several hundred calories off in a diet app makes it hard to trust.   Full Review   \n", " Great! I love that you can use the barcode to log calories....what I would love to tweak, would be logging excersise calories burned, because there is a differnce in your number to what I abctually burn. I would love it if you were able to change the number and allow you to type in notes like cardio trainer app. I went from a 4 star to a 3 star due to me switching from a fitbit to a Garmin Vivofit HR and lose it does not sync with Garmin products, super dissapointing.   Full Review   \n", " Great App but it's frustratingly slow at times I switched from Myfitnesspal app to this. I like it overall but when searching the food database, I find it to be way too slow. There should be an option to download the food database to the app and for it to update the cached database automatically. This would speed up searches greatly and I believe fix my issues.

Socializing is impossible as you can't add or even find your friends using the app or on the site . Most of the sites working functions can be found on other apps without the the load of adds and mediocrity.

{"reviews": [" The app is nice, but title is misleading As a student music therapist, I can see myself using this app for my relaxation sessions, but I can assure everyone this is NOT music therapy. We go to college for a continued 4 years minimum, study many of the subjects our nursing, occupational therapy, and many other health profession students study. We cannot be replaced by an app, but we constantly fight this stigma. I would enjoy this app more if it didnt have a misleading (and in some ways illegal) title, and hope that the makers consider change it.

Just a frozen screen. Fix this and you have 5 stars from me.   Full Review   \n", "  Love it! It can be used for many things... Sleep, Relax time, Nap time for children... I have even put it on while cleaning my house or driving in my car... I give it a 5... However, it could be improved. By additional sounds, shuffle, and add your own... But to be free, It's Awesome!   Full Review   \n", " Yes!!! I'm already an insomniac, and now I'm pregnant. Sound sleep is hard to come by. I am a chronic TV on at night sleeper and it usually just seemed to keep me up. I liked the noise, but it was distracting. Also, I live in a not so quiet neighborhood. That being said, I feel asleep in less than 20 minutes with this app. I love that you can personalize the sounds. Floating in the city with waves added was perfect. It does drain the battery a bit, but that's to be expected if you're playing it all night. Get it!   Full Review   \n", " Was nice until you can't turn piano off Hate sleeping to piano. You can adjust the volume to all the good sounds but not the piano music. Killed the app for me. I'll keep searching for a great non piano sleep app. What a shame.

The piano music is very good...audio quality is amazing.  see, what more you can improve on..   Full Review   \n", " Nice job Pretty good app comparing to others I have tried. There is still room for improvement (mainly on the design) but you did a very good job with the sounds, and with the fact we can play them independently of the songs. Excellent!

Thanks for the creator \ud83d\ude0a   Full Review   \n", "  This isn't a rating.  I want to know, before I keep this app, why the app \"needs access to the SMS & the device call information\"?
