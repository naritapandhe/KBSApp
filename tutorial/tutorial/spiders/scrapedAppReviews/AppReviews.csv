"So far so good!   Working good and showing correct info. The UI and especially the round widget looks really beautiful. I have a request. *EDIT: Thanks for listening to my request to add default clock in ""tap on clock"" option from settings* 5 stars here.       Thank you for considering the request, hope this beautiful app will never be bloated in future. Thank you :)      ","GulfJet Graphics 5 Stars, accuracy 2 stars. You report SNOW BLIZZARD where is NONE. The temperature is off most of the time. It's a pity. Take a close look at your Wx provider. I do like the program, but it should deliver the Wx as accurate as possible. Kind regards .... Well, the program still reported ""Snow Blizzard"" with a Outside Temp. 06 C. I live on the south side of the Jura mountain at 840 meters in Switzerland, maybe this helps a bit.

First an amount of Rs.10/- deducted and after few minutes again an amount of Rs.50/- was deducted. Why this cheating from the customer?      ,These app suks The worst app I've ever purchased why does the widget not working when i put a widget on the home screen theres no weather coming out pls. Fix these ok      ,Weather Live Apalon app Great weather app for Android. Like the layout & ability to see weather in many places all together in one place. (iOS app can show a temperature graph for the day but this one doesn't). A very good app even though forecast is out sometimes!      ,No. Hate the red clouds background when skies are grey during day time. Please add a grey clouds background and remove that hideous red cloud apocalypse garbage.  It makes cloudy days worse.      ,Fairly accurate most the time unlike like the other weather apps I'm currently running two separate apps on my phone for weather and this one is definitely better and more accurate.      ,Best weather application! This is a great application for all weather enthusiasts. The best one I have used with up to date reports as well as a beautiful widget choice for all likes. I  would highly recommend this application to anybody looking for a very informative and great working weather application.      ,"Galaxy S5 City is always changing. I'm 8 hrs from Minneapolis, MN but I got their weather. I thought it was something I was doing wrong. The information is inaccurate outside of 15 degrees.  I would not suggest this app.  Especially don't buy until you're sure, but that's with everthing. Good luck      ",Seems better Than when posted last year so increased rating.  Could do with some more widget styles and also when click on clock should take you straight to clock not the app for you to click again      ,"Great! Great app! Attractive interface, accurate forecasts... What more could you want!      ","Great app Accurate, looks good on the whole, forecast too small.  Would be good to show location in the widget.      ","Pretty, but useless. The app and widget do not work correctly if you have a battery saver or anti-virus installed. This was told to me by their own customer support. Why should I have to turn off my battery saver to use their program?  There are plenty of free options out there. I feel like I am owed a refund. Stay away.

Love it      ,accurate and beautiful wonderful app. worth the money      ,"So Simple,  yet so much. This app is a very simple one to use,  but has a lot of widgets.  I love it,  with its nice layout,  and simple design. The images change according to the weather and time of day.

Also it does not list the town where I live it picks up a city 4 towns away thats the weather i  have to go by. The style is very good and i like the widgets but still needs improvements ..      ,Looking forward to use this app I've used the free version and I wasn't disappointed. Now it's time to put the live wallpaper to the test.      ,"memory hog, leaks My S5 was unresponsive so I found that live wallpaper was consuming 500MB RAM. Removed that, but using widget still was consuming around 250MB. I uninstalled it for now. Please mem profile and fix :-)      ",Add a Future Radar Cast & I'll love it Beautiful layout and look. The accuracy is great too. There is a lot going for this app. It's well worth the price for the full features. Unfortunately I have had to keep a second weather app because a major feature is missing. I took a star off because there is no future radar cast. That is a feature that would increase the rating to 5 stars for me. Hopefully that can be added in a future update soon. I'd love to only have one weather app that does it all!      ,Mr Chris Reeve A very good app can't really fault it . Does the job      ,"Not as good as I thought. What is with it only updating every 30 mins???? Temps & weather changes faster than that. The graphics don't keep up either obviously. Why can't it be every 10 mins like the rest?? Wish I hadn't bought the full version, otherwise I would uninstall.

Really like the widget but please fix the accuracy. I'm in Staaken Berlin Germany by the way.      ,Great app! Clean user interface. Accurate and easy to use. Keep up the great work devs.      ,Great app Love this app. The devs are really quick to respond and are very helpful.

I've only given 3 stars because it looks amazing but the weather info is very inaccurate. Maybe a good idea if we could choose who the info came from. Like some other apps.      ,"Says ""network error occurred"" but my Internet is fine. Such a disappointment for a pretty app. Update: Reboot worked! Thanks!      ","It does the job Have it on my Nvidia Shield, so far so good      ",Good little app Does what's expected.  Good graphics.      ,Seems good So far so good. But a bit inaccurate      ,"Good, solid app! It's not as customizable as my last free app, but it's got more important features like barometric pressure, rain totals, etc. I also haven't seen any ads yet which is totally worth a buck!!      ","Missing important information I live in an extremely hot and sunny area, I was hoping this app would have the max daily UV index in it so I could prepare myself, otherwise it's a great app. Hope to see this feature soon.      ","Not bad Lovely design, temp is good. Really good looking widget.      ",Looks great but stopped working Really love it. But now it simply stopped working. It is just stuck on a black background not changing or moving or anything. I keep having to restart it. Sort of pointless to do that for a background. Nexus 6p.      ,"Great concept, but could have been done better in my opinion. You can only choose from a few layouts, all of which consist of pretty much the same few objects, shifted around. It would be nice to be able to choose from 2 or 3 sets of shapes instead of being stuck to a flower that's petals shift around. The app's setting also seem confusing. It would be helpful to see explanations for what some of the sliders do.      ",Worth the money This has to be 1 of the coolest live wallpapers on the market works flawlessly on my LG G4 it is awesome lots of customisation      ,"Beautiful Performance on Note 4 Lollipop Brilliant, realtime camera adaptation is magnificent to behold in this wallpaper. Going into the wallpaper's settings lets you adjust how often the camera refreshes, how often the layout animates, and how quickly it animates. Frankly, the out-of-the-box settings are so visually enticing that you may want to tone them down so that you can actually do whatever it was you wanted to do on your device! Well done, dev. Certainly worth three times the price.      ",Very cool app I love this app. I'm showing it off all the time. This is a terrific way to personalize your phone.      ,"Awesome Awesome is the word to describe this app. It needs improvement in adapting the exact color, but still I'll give it a 5 star.      ","Love it Only one thing frustrates me. PLEASE ADD AN OPTION TO DISABLE DOUPLE TAP TO REFRESH OR TO DISABLE THE USE OF THE CAMERA COMPLETELY. Whenever I swipe through my screens the layout and colors change, and this frustrates me because it's using the camera which means more battery wasted. The last two refresh options say ""no camera"" but this isn't true for either of them because the camera is still used if it registers a double tap, even if it's just from swiping through your screens. 4 stars until then.      ","Doesn't work with Nova launcher S6 Says ""Application not installed""      ",My favorite wallpaper app I like this for a number of reasons. It follows the Material Design theme. It's customizable. My icons and widgets are fully visible over the wallpaper. Also it doesn't seem to drain battery from my s6 Active.      ,Yep.

Still get some crashes, if I launch an app while it's still changing.  For a request, I'd like to be able to save a color scheme. Maybe a triple tap. Also, an option for two finger tap, so it doesn't change colors when I open a shutter in action launcher.  Thanks!

The NSA don't care about you. You're just another insignificant tool. OUTSTANDING APP. EASILY WORTH THE MODEST FEE. As an enthusiastic personalization app purchaser, I try and buy (and refund) a lot of apps every week and this one definitely ranks in my top 5 of 2015. Good work, Dev. Now, time to spread the word...      "," I just hope the double tap option can manage to minimize the battrey usage, great app.      ",Novel idea! I'll use it from time to time but I'll return to my solid black  wallpaper for daily use (I'm very battery conscious). But I do like  it. Imagine the fun once technology discovers/invents an unlimited power source. Cool app.      ,Beautiful Work as advertised. I Like it. But there is conflict with double tap on LG G2 because double tapping is lock screen. Please find workaround because I don't want to waste battery.

Unfortunately it does take a lot of battery...still love to show it off...      ,"Cool looking and elegant I love the look of these live wallpapers, there are some great customisation options and amazing themes to start you off. I've not used this long enough to comment on the battery but it would have to eat my battery life for me to ditch such a fantastic looking app.      ",Problems on Note 4 with Exynos and higher resolution Upvote so they fix it. Poor framerate on the Galaxy Note 4 with Exynos. Maybe it's not optimized for Exynos yet? It used to run very smoothly on my Note 3 with snapdragon. I absolutely love this app but please fix it!      ,"Only one thing I'd improve It's a great app and great value. The wallpapers are beautiful and you can change them at will or make your own. Only thing I'd improve are the editing tools. Color tools are a bit strange and editing can be a bit clunky, but I've seen way worse and they are definitely usable if you spend a little time.      ","Shaky hand effect I love this wallpaper and it really brings pretty wallpapers to the home screen, but there's one thing that bothers me a bit and could improve - I like the quick movement of objects when I move my phone, but a shaky hand and/or small movement will make everything jitter in an ugly fashion. Maybe a dampening factor could be applied to the initial movement to remove the shaky hand jitters from the wallpaper? This way the objects won't jitter, quiver, and/or shake as I'm holding the phone :)      ","Awesome. On a QHD screen the sheer quality of these wallpapers has to be SEEN, very impressive wallpapers and very powerful editing, a little fiddly to use but the results I achieved....are for me amazing.... account sync across devices has been a brilliant blessing, cos editing really needs a large screen. The randomizer is superb, and running my own design's through Muzei with the colours changing every 30 second's brilliant.      ","Unstable tilt effect The tilt effect is gone after a while. No matter what I do, I can't bring it back. Only by restarting the phone it will works again. Please fix it      ",GREAT! Lock screen? Is there a way to use this and make a lock screen wallpaper? This is an amazig app and I loce it but I really want to have one for my lock screen      ,"Great live wallpaper On moving to a Samsung S7 Edge found the tilt effect is very jerky, even when set to say less than 14%.

So far, no performance issues      ","Doesn't stay on screen Samsung S6, it will allow me to set the wallpaper and all is good until phone goes in standby,  when you wake the phone it has reset itself to the default wallpaper. Kind of useless.      ","Bought for support. The free version already had the theme I was going to use.

I even paid for the full app. However, we have to adjust with only lines and circles and use our ingenuity. Would give 5*s for implementing my request.      ","Great Amazing wallpapers. One bug: if you turn the phone beyond the wallpapers capability, instead of stopping it crashes the homescreen.

With my custom notifications set up, I can instantly tell what types of notification I've received without even picking up my phone.      ","I am giving this 5 Stars but also warning of a shortcoming on it. I use Lightflow for custom vibrations on Smartwatches, and to also remove the ability for notifications content to show up on the watch.So all I get is  the custom vibration I set for each type of alert and I can tell what type of notification it is without looking. this works great with android wear watches.   The shortcoming is in the Garmin brand watches I have recently switched over to Fenix 3 HR and Garmin connect supports being notified of notifications from 3rd party's so i thought ""AWESOME"" just add lightflow to garmin connect app so garmin listens for lightflow notifications. However its not that simple. I cant get lightflow to work with garmin watches at all for notification vibs being sent to wearables.  Despite that I LOVE this product I really do extremely useful for modifying how alerts hit you for notifications. I cant tell you how many times Lightflow has stopped me from pulling my phone out because of custom alerts and knowing the notification was not important based on the vib profile.

","Some stuff needs fixing in the Nexus 6P All of the options work for the app notifications but there are some weird bugs with the app regarding the Nexus 6P. In both the legacy and full version the screen lights up too often randomly as if someone touched the phone. I checked several times and it only happens when the app is enabled. Also, the notification sound sounds twice and overlaps. I haven't figured out how to change that. I had used this app in previous devices but I find these bugs annoying for the Nexus 6P.      ","Control! Thanks for control that the apps don't provide over the colors and sounds. Now my LED colors match the app icon color so that I know what update I've got, and the sounds do too (instagram=shutter click, twitter=bird chirp, etc.). Great app!      ",Doesn't work properly with Textra It's a solid app however it doesn't work well with Textra rather than the normal Messenger app. Would be nice to have this fixed.

I can't even add the notification.  I choose the account, but it doesn't show up in my notification list in Light Flow.      ","Love,  but broken on Note 4 Marshmallow update Since my Samsung note 4 forced me to take the Marshmallow upgrade, some notifications just don't work. The red light I use with Nine shows up fine, but Hangouts or SMS are always a blinking blue light no matter what my settings are. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app and made sure it had all the needed permissions and I still see this behavior. I'd make this a 5 star if this was fixed.

Hopefully the bugs get worked out.      ,it doesn't work for some odd reason no notification light on my phone.      ,Been using Light Flow for at least 6 years love it.

It gives my phone a great look and the number of customizable options is awesome. My one complaint is that when my phone restarts, I have to set up the wallpaper again. If that was fixed, then my rating would be five stars. On a side note, it would be awesome to have a fire option to go along with the smoke and water options. It would be sweet to have realistic-looking Mario-style fireballs bouncing across the screen as a live wallpaper. Just sayin'.

I'd love your feedback on those if you check them out.   P.s. I might've embellished when I wrote ""2,500"" lol ... sorry. But still... All of my apps are themed.

I am unable to add system widgets on the latest android version for my Samsung s6 and this is happening for months now. Still no fix and not a word from support!

Even with all settings set to allow notifications, both in phone settings and app settings, Next Launcher 3D fails to show notifications within the app. The accessory app, Next Notification, doesn't work either.

Dead in less than a day.  Remove this and that bloody go weather ( which is forcefully bundled with ads) and it's back to 2 and a half days battery.  That's no coincidence. Also pushes you to install go locker,  more bloat more battery hogs.  Combined cost of laucher and weather fifteen pound?

Basically totally screwed.  And no help or reply from development so screw ya's      ,"Search over. Best launcher EVER. Absolutely LUV this launcher!! Has amazing themes and I get ridiculous number of compliments on my phone. My ONLY gripe I'd actually of extreme annoyance. The icon spacing change entirely too much. So as u add new apps to your homescreen, they normally won't fit correctly with previous apps. Worthy of 2 star loss but I luv the app so much I'll just snatch one. HUGE issue tho      ","This is a very good Launcher, though time consuming to set up and with poor documentation.   At  12 it is expensive for an Android app, but not bad value for money for an app that is in use every day  I'd give it 5 stars apart from the fact that is does not hold separate configurations for Landscape and Portrait modes. On my Samsung tablet, I use it equally in either orientation, and although set up and working well in portrait mode, switching to landscape sees the icons all over the place. Other launchers in the past have been capable of applying a different setting between the 2 modes. Hopefully something the developers might consider.      ","This launcher is freakin awesome!! I love this launcher. I can basically create my own themes. With my Note5 and Sketchbook app, i can DRAW my own icons!! My Note5 looks like a totally customized phone. I use the 2D version for this. 3D is ok, but not as cool as the fully customizable 2D version. I bought a google play gift card with a bestbuy gift card. Totally worth the price. Really!!!! RUNS SMOOOOOTH!!!      ","I really like the look and feel of this app. Love the ""3D"" aspect. But...  Are the developers done creating themes?  The current selection is nice, but they're getting stale.  Also, the 2-for-1 themes (launcher and lock screen) won't allow application unless you have Go Locker installed. Locker's nice, but, dear Lord is it a battery hog. The current setup means I have to install Locker, apply the theme I want for the launcher, then disable the Locker portion. I'd say ""you get what you pay for"", but Next is the most expensive launcher I've seen  Until the above issues are remedied, I won't be able to recommend this app to anyone. Especially not at this price point.      ","Hopelessly, Happily, Hooked! I've never actually reviewed an app before.

","Slows and freezes my phone I love the idea of this app. BUT, it has three major drawbacks, so I'm quite upset that I spent $17 on it. First, it drains my battery FAST. I went from only having to charge my phone once a day to having to charge it between 5 & 7 times a day. Second, it made my phone incredibly sluggish. Third, my phone froze up A LOT. Do not recommend buying this app especially at the ridiculously high price of $17.      ",No support? Very few updates in the last few years. Not many widgets. I was hoping that would improve over the last couple years but hasn't. Notes disappear. Posted about issues and never got a response surprisingly since small free apps have answered my questions or concerns pretty quickly. IDK. Expected more I guess.      ,Best launcher I think I've used pretty much every launcher out there but next launcher is I think with out a doubt the best launcher out there so customizable takes a bit of getting used to at first but that's because there's so much in the launcher once you've set it how you like it going to any other launcher will just not do it is a bit pricey but I think  worth every penny as they've crammed so much in to it      ,"Classic mode 5*/ 3d 3* Love the classic mode! Straightforward simple navigation with plenty of customizations. However, 3d mode and themes are a bit tacky for my taste. Customer support sorely lacking.

However, it crashes frequently and freezes your phone forcing you to restart.  And it seems like the newest update is worse instead of improved.

Several of the menu options would not allow me to select the visible options, that was pretty frustrating. Other than fixing the widgets, I would only ask for one other feature, and I know it won't be easy. Have a searchable buttons option for when manually selecting them. Use key words or something. At the very least have an index at the beginning to make it easier to navigate.

Running on Honor 5x with Android 5.1.1 and unless I restart my phone the Widgets do not update the time, battery life, or weather. I spent hours setting this up just the way I want with Nova and really want to give the 5  but can't until I know what's causing this problem.      ","Nice This is a great skin, especially if you enjoy Fallout. But if you simply want something completely different, you need this. My only complaint is that once you build your widgets, you should be able to lock them without the resizing tool appearing. Besides that, I love it.      ","Love it Absolutely love it. A must have for fallout fans. My friends with iPhone's are jealous and every non fallout fans think it looks great. I wish that the clean master one touch clean icon would change to green as well though.

","Had Beautiful Widgets on my home screen for 7 years. ""The widgets are indeed beautiful, absolutely wonderful looking. Very clean and trimmed, absolutely exactly what I was looking for."" I wrote that seven years ago, just after I got my HTC G1, the first Android phone.

The interface for the weather details is horrible tho      ","Widget disappears after restart I've had this app (bought the pro) for at least four years, loved it and always installed on different phones. Lately anytime I restart my phone the widget disappears... Says ""tap to reload"" but that does nothing. Really annoying having to ALWAYS re-configure the widget.      ","Why do updates wipe widgets? Every time this app updates, I have to redo the widgets. Is it really impossible to make them stay or relaunch after an update? How come other widgets update just fine?      ","Works Well.       I didn't try the open app widgets Does it's job well, it's just not what I want. Daydream works well and I LOVE the windscreen wiper & blowing clouds animations for transitions. The constrained versions of widgets is disappointing, I wish there were layout + button changes to download - not just backgrounds and fonts.       Thank you for showing me WeatherUnderground - public weather stations are &lt;\i&gt;&lt;\b\&gt;great.      ",Notification Font Color Please make the notification Font color dark or give us an option to change it. Lollipop notifications are white now so it is not visible.

However, ever since a recent update, the clock freezes solid, rendering it useless.  If this doesn't get fixed soon, i will have to find another clock/weather app, and I'm not looking forward to that.      ",Please fix! Have had this app for yrs on different devices with no problems. Loved this app till a few weeks ago. Widget is a ghost widget. When I retrieve the info it still does not fix the problem. Would love to rate higher if problem is fixed...      ,Nice enough widgets but a little unimaginative now. Watch out for updates; they kill off your widgets and you have to build them from scratch every time.

Droid RAZR MAXX.      ,"One for the all time list! This was one of my first apps I used on my OD (original droid)! And have been using it ever since!

Only thing missing is a toggle setting for Google drive mode. Update:geolocation is working again, well done!      ","Stupid clock freezes I've been a long time user of BW. Been having this issue on and off for years. I love the app, almost too much to ditch it. Using Pro version, now thinking it was possibly a waste of money to purchase. Has potential to be a 5 star app.      ","The only widget I use is the clock/weather 4x4. Its been a staple of mine for years. Bought a Huawei P8 and the widget simply doesnt update. Weather doesn't refresh, even the clock stays locked at the time the widget has been applied. Only fix I can find is to force the app to run at all times (even when sleeping). Led me to believe the app is not updating when coming out of sleep, as it usually does.      ","Beautiful widgets pro I have had this on all my cell phones in the past and the app always worked great. I have recently upgraded to Galaxy Note 5 and there seems to be some bugs. The widgets no longer keep accurate weather or time. I have to keep restarting my cell phone. Please fix as soon as possible then I will upgrade my review, Thanks      ","Like the app but....(problems) I really like the app, there is just some things that need to be fixed before I give 5 stars. 1.) when looking at the themes and you hit download, and scroll down (while downloading) it stops downloading whatever your trying to download. 2.) when looking at the themes and you go to a different app it's starts the themes from the very top. So unless you don't mind loosing your place don't leave the app.      ",Used to love this I've spent many happy hours fiddling about getting this widget just perfect for my theme and I loved it. Now I'm on marshmallow it no longer keeps accurate time; it's constantly lagging. No good if the clock doesn't keep the right time. Actually pretty pointless now. Unhappy.      ,"New widgets don't work. I've had this app for a very long time, have always loved it but now it simply doesn't work. I deleted my widget and tried to place a new one, configured it and hit the check box, the configuration closes but no widget appears. There is still space on the screen where it should be but nothing. I go and check the configuration and it says it's there. So I have invisible clock widget? I cleared the data and cache from the app then uninstalled and reinstalled with the same results. Completely broken please fix      ","Yeah, I reviewed this for YOU Great way to make the weather, among other things on your phone Pop.  I remember way back about 5 years ago this being the only app of its kind really it seems , to the near over whelming options of today.  Still holding strong.

","Time and weather don't update Like the selection and customizability of widgets but often find that the widget breaks after a while on certain launchers (grey box appears and can't load widget). I've also found that in the latest update even when adjusting the update interval in the settings the time, weather and location gets stuck and has to be updated manually. This is kind of a pain. If those things were fixed it'd be back up to a 5-star review until then it just aint...      ",I keep hoping I wonder if this app is still being supported I know the community is not active and almost positive this isn't. hasn't been updated since April 2015. Samsung galaxy s6. Would be nice if you could have weather and battery status in the same widget      ,"Garbage, Doesn't update after phone screen lock Works until your phone screen locks... unlock it and its set to your old time.. the lock screen and status bar clocks both work fine so im guessing it crashes.  If remove and re add widget it works... waste of money.  It should be beautiful clock and weather widget because thats all there is, no calendar widgets etc!!!!!      ","Simply, a resource hog. Yes, developer, can you like optimize this app so that it does not suck up as  much 35% of memory resources while putting a heavy drain on the battery. This app is still useful but it has gotten worse as more features are added. Thank you. Last RATING above was three stars. Now, when I hit the weather icon, I get ads telling me that my phone is infected, The widget does not keep correct time.It is the purchased version. Man, this app has become really useless. A sign of an orphaned or abandoned app.      ","Last few months doesn't work correctly The time is always incorrect, I delete and reput the widget. Default skins and it just doesn't work, either frozen in time or an hour behind      ",An app I regret buying It was great when I initially bought it but now it's crap. The issue of things being too close together on the widgets were never fixed. Not to mention it's clearly not kept up to date even though are still clearly problems.  Just bad.      ,"Please update weather animation Has always been one of my favorite apps and has been on every device I have owned. Two things that need attention... 1) the notification on 5.1 does not show properly, it shows all in white so it can't be read. 2) one of my favorite features is the weather animation on the app main screen but it has been the same for far too long. It needs an awesome update to keep the app fresh. Developer please look into this.      ","Started off nice.. Started off as a great attractive app.. I even bought the pro version, so I could use the awesome live wallpaper... Excellent... So why the  one star- hated it review you ask?... I put the weather widget on my home screen.. The first screen I see, for weather at a glance.. Well I noticed that its much hotter outside than the widget says it is... I then noticed it had not refreshed in 283 hours. And won't update even manually.. So a weather widget app, with broken widgets that are useless is one star-... Fix it and I'll be glad to edit this review.. Thanks for listening.

It just looks so pixellated on newer phones      ","Add many more things I really love this app but it needs an update to app many more things. They should add turtles,frogs,Insects,water falls water control,many more plants and other fish such as common pond fish and new themes      ","Beautiful. Request. Can you add an option to automatically cycle through the backgrounds like once a day? That way every day the fish will swim in a different environment. Otherwise, gorgeous. Also find a way to point users from the free app to the paid app. Took me a while to find it and I almost gave up finding the paid version.      ","Best ever wallpaper! Once you pay the 99 cents, you can pick your background, lighting, water effects, fish and their sizes, even make lighting change with the time of day, FEED the fish with multiple taps...best ever! If you tap a fish it rushes off!      Same goes for their aquarium except you can't pick fish sizes there, but if you pick 2 of the same type of fish or two turtles, jellyfish or seahorses, they won't be the same size. I'm back to buy more of Kittehface's I love them so much... Cell & tablet download for 1 buy!      ",Gorgeous lwp I love this koi pond wallpaper. It is so beautiful and realistic. Looks amazing on my tablet. I also love that you can feed the fish. Very cool!      ,Wonderful but could be better. Everything about this wallpaper is spectacular EXCEPT the resolution of the background. Any wallpaper you set just looks terrible on today's HD devices even when specifically providing images in the recommended 1024x512 resolution.      ,"THESE DON'T SMELL FISHY I've always loved going fishing . Catch and release fishing . And... I've always found Koi Fish fascinating and beautiful . With this app there's so many backgrounds and the color and sizes of fish you choose . Also you can play with these by just simply touching them . After you touch their tails they take off swimming very quickly . I choose the full version because it's simply better with more features . I would advise fish lovers to have this app along with anyone else . Kids ,people who landscape, ect.      ",Great live wallpaper. I did not realize that the Koi fish would be swimming under the icons on my screen. I thought it was just a screensaver. I guess that's what the live wallpaper means. Great surprise. It is worth many times the 99 cents that it cost. I put this app on both of my Android devices. Great app.      ,No hi-res background? The background is still low-res even though I manually pick a hi-res image.      ,Stands test of time I find myself always coming back to this live wallpaper. Customization of koi fish is great. Only improvement i can think of is support for higher resolution backgrounds. Will this be possible in some future update?      ,Lovely Though the way the fish move is a biy unrealistic I love the customizable interface. Lots of fun to be had.      ,"BEST & MOST BEAUTIFUL Live Walpaper ever! Totally worth paying for full version. Just purchased the full version of the Koi Live Wallpaper. I had the free version on my Samsung Infuse many years ago, and loved it; there's nothing that conpares, as far as live wallpapers go.  I later tried to install it on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2, without success. I just found the free version again yesterday and installed it on my Galaxy Note 4, it's absolutely gorgeous! This morning noticed that the full version was $0.99, and couldn't pass it up. Thanks for this beautiful wallpaper!      ","Ridiculous that you haven't fixed the glitch yet! I won't buy anymore of your product until you show me you care about your customer. I downloaded this over a month and a half ago and love it but I'm super frustrated that my glitches still haven't been fixed! It's glitching out on my note 4 but works fine on my lg tablet.  On the note, I can't personalize the background, it just stays on one that's provided . I also think it's hard to customize the fish because the select is hard to see.      ",Was 5 stars but now 1 star This app is in desperate need of a major update! Was great back in 2012 on my galaxy s2 but now its 2015 and phones are qhd now... it looks terrible... u guys seem to have given up on development      ,"YAY! So happy to see this old favorite available for my android. Only one problem: when I had it in the past it cycled through the day/night cycle correctly, but now it's out of sync. For instance, right now it's in sunset, almost night, but the sun won't set here for another 2.5 hours. Any way to adjust that? My location is on. Not a big deal, but in the old days I loved sitting outside with a cup of tea, watching the rosey sunrise mirrored by my koi pond. Very realistic and relaxing!      ","The Top live wallpaper Been using it for years, Nothing out there better in my opinion .      ","I LOVE this app Works great on both my Samsung S5 and TabS. It's peaceful, relaxing and great graphics. I can't express how much I love this app. I have a blank screen on my tablet just so I can watch the fishes. And I have a blast feeding them and then watching my cats try to catch the Koi as they swim to the next screen and disappear. It's a blast!      ","Love it on my Lenovo tablet Installed on my Lenovo 10 tablet and it's 100% working. Lovely display very pleasant to watch. Note on my Lenovo it would disappear from the screen after powering the tablet off. I found this was because I had installed it on my SD card, transferring it to the tablets internal memory completely cured this. Great app.      ",One of my favorites I'm running this on an S4. It ran great on 4.4.2. I thought it was causing battery drain on 5.01 when that update rolled out. I had factory reset before the udpate and right after the udpate (based on issues I read about). After a few tweaks and restarts (do this every a.m.) the phone seemed to be fine with battery life again so I installed this app again. Been running fine since.

It doesn't drain my battery in any ridiculous kind of way, either. The only thing that would make it better would be of the lily pads and flowers were on a layer above the water so they didn't ripple when you tap the surface or when you have the rain setting on.      ","Beautiful But Unreliable This is a beautiful and realistic looking app. I felt as if I had pets that I don't have to clean up after.  However, even though I paid for the premium version it keeps disappearing from my screen. Just now I went into the settings to restore it-  TWICE - and nothing happened. I still have the default wallpaper. At this point I don't have what I paid for. Please fix this or I will have to uninstall and demand a refund. Otherwise, if it stayed put I would be more than happy to give it five stars.      ","Great but could be Awesome One of the best live wallpaper. It runs perfectly smooth and the fish swim naturally. There are a lot of different customizations. This app is definitely worth buying. You will not be disappointed. However it would be nicer if the backgrounds were HD and on my Galaxy S3 I can no longer set custom backgrounds, please fix this.

In this app, you can choose from 9 different koi fish, change environmental backdrops, decorate the pond with flowers and lily pads, make it rain and...I kidd you not...have your wallpaper...change times depending on the time of day. I could even size the koi fish however I wanted and customize the backdrops and colors of the times of day. You can even make ripples in the water as if you were actually touching it! Despite the slight bad quality of some of the environment backdrops, this Koi live Wallpaper was exceptional! Definitely worth the $0.99...      ",Great Really love this wallpaper.  Lots of people have commented on it.  In this particular version though the section to edit the fish has become really small to see what you are editing.      ,Love this This is the first app I've purchased and its wonderful. I love all the settings there are. The only thing that would be nice is if the pictures of the fish were a little bigger in the settings section. They are hard to choose when they are so tiny.

Now when I want to change the theme on the premium one it tells me to download the old one and then I apply the theme and it makes mes me switch from the premium to the ad version. Should of just kept the ad one. Now my premium keyboard is plain. Can someone help me!      ,Its ok but....

I have been using this keyboard for over a year now, non stop, and I haven't had any complaints up until now. I would really like to see an update pushed through that allows the option to use the Emoji One faces. I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Keyboard is okay. Customizing it is pretty glitchy but I think that's just to force you to download their themes. Main reason I plan to uninstall is the awful autocorrect. Doesn't fix words that are barely misspelled and changes ones that aren't. Needs a heavy update and then it'd be worth having.      ,Love it Would there be any way to implement custom sizing for the keyboard rather than having just 3 options for size?

I've downloaded 3 full version wallpapers so far from these guys, and I love all of them. $.99 each? Pffft....that's a no-brainer. Each one is well worth the measly dollar I paid.

I absolutely love this LW,  the animated galaxys are beautiful and it comes with the ability to be used as an Android DayDream screen saver, I didn't know this at the time of purchase and I was very excited to learn that this LW had that ability.

Literally just as good if not faster and more smooth than on Windows or Mac. Absolutely LOVE this app, I use it all the time playing music.

I'm sure you've seen lightning that seemingly flickers in the clouds. Perhaps something similar can be done? Cuz at the moment it's all flashes or full bolts. Would seem much more like a  realistic feel with the flickered flashes (of course be careful for seizures! ). Or even a full screen flash for the bolts that are close to the screen. Or even perhaps making bolts that branch out more or less with a slider.      ","Love it The clouds and thunder look great.

However, this app is pretty realistic looking (I turned off the blowing rain and just set it to have rain drops show up on the camera lens). We have ""heat"" lightning where we live, so this app looks really similar (the lightning patterns are definitely very random).  Paid App has many adjustable settings such as daylight / dawn / dusk / night-time light levels, numbers of clouds, and rain or no rain.  Lightning flashes can be set to random colors, and they can be set to flash where you touch the screen (I turned the latter off).  For me (and I'm cheap), the $0.99 was well worth it.

",Stunning App This is by far the most beautiful Live Wallpaper App Ever...Worth the Money...Does what it says...  Thx      ,Just Wow I just love these HD earth themes      ,"Beautifu, BUT... Lots of great thing to choose from in the settings, but on my asus transformer 100, it restraints the machine, even by scrolling on between pages      ","Marvellous! The visual is simply amazing, the only wallpaper that I actually purchased. Well worth the money!      ",Super Beeeyyoooossssmmmm! I just love it so much!  DEV you did it too good!  *hats off *      ,Nice app Looks good would be even better if you added parallax      ,"Earth HD deluxe edition Realistic, but earth is spinning the wrong way...sun suppose to set in the west, not raise.      ",Love it Best $1 I've spent on Google.      ,Wow! Spectacular visuals!      ,Love it! I love all the settings! It never gets old. Great job devs!      ,Live Earth Sweet      ,It's the best      ,Awesome Earth      ,Works      ,Use the free version ONLY This was a beautiful program. The graphics were outstanding and everyone I showed it to were absolutely amazed at the quality. Then I made the mistake of buying the full version. Now with the full version there is a light blue haze covering almost the entire planet except for the very center.  Changing the settings has no effect on the haze. It ruins the planet graphics. Use the free version only or you will be GREATLY disappointed.      ,"Nice Love it ,cool and realistic graphics. .      ",The only live wallpaper to have Forget all the flashy stuff and cartoons.  This one gives you a perspective on life itself.      ,Nice but not precise Nice wallpaper however I bought it to have a fixed view on my current Google/gps location and see the status of the sun over the earth. I could never find such option and noticed that the realistic earth shows time delay (sun is approximately 1 to 2 hours late) and it is not possible to have a fixed view; moreover the seasons seems not to be realistically rendered. Wallpaper for less than 1 euro so I increase by 1 star. Should it be improved to make it more realistic it would definitely be rated 5*      ,It's good! Worth it! Very humbling- I'm very glad I got it!      ,"Awesome Best earth app, should make a nuclear war option with nukes going off all over the earth      ","Please fix small issue Would rate 5 stars, but in ""fixed"" mode, you can't offset the planet vertically or horizontally like you can with every other scrolling option.  I don't want swiping to rotate the Earth, but I also want the planet offset, and the way the app is set up currently this is not possible (and there seems to be no good reason why).  If you could fix this, I'd be ultra appreciative.      ","Realest Earth Wallpaper On The Market Graphics are outstanding, love the look and feel. Keeping this for a while. Keep up the great work. Any possibility we might see more planets. Would love to see Saturn and all of its beautiful glory in HD! This is a keeper wallpaper for sure!!      ","Not as good as solar system I wish this used gyroscope to give you the 3 d effect that program has. Asteroids would be nice in this as well. That would give you 5 stars like the other app. You could look ""behind "" the space station and around the planet.      ",Earth HD Picture of the earth in realistic view.  Good  wallpaper.  The Earth keeps spinning and that is a truth of each day.  That's why I like it.  The different settings are interesting also.      ,"Please add qhd quality Everithing was perfect when a had this lwp on my htc m7 - 4,7 hd screen, but now I own a note 4 - 5,7 qhd screen, and suddenly the quality is not that great. Please ad qhd quality. Thanks!      ","Thats all it does! Useless!! I can play with the earth. Change it from real, to classic to frozen. Wow. I had to pay a dollar once it downloaded, wait for nearly 10 minutes for it to finish... not to have a new ""tool"", but an app like the fake lighter. Deleting, keep my dollar... your app sucks.      ","Great wallpaper but needs updating This wallpaper doesn't seem to be compatible with Lollipop 5.0. The offset values don't do anything and no matter what I do, the camera keeps Earth right in the center of the screen. Also, you can't hide the app icon, which is REALLY annoying. 5 stars when fixed.      ",Thy should add different planet's that will be so awesome      ,"Nice background, but you really should be able to set your location more accurately. I checked the place to do so, but the earth view looks like it's set to Eastern Standard Time.      ","Oh my gosh. Best deal ever I love this, its awsome.      ",Earth HD ed Beautiful app . thanks .      ,Best earth orbit wallpaper !!      ,"Abandoned Hasn't bin a update in ages, and wile this app used to be gorgeous now on my note 4 it doesn't look sharp. A shame cos on a 1440p screen it should.      ",Amezig planet Congrats to yhe programe team...you creat such a meevelous tutorial wall paper. Actually we the middle classes are unable to fly on such a hight from where people can see the beutiful planet. So done a good job. Any body can fill the expreience of watching amazing beautifull PLANET           ,"Great app! Amazing graphics, totally worth its price      ",Earth HD Very realistic. Great visual effects. Love it!      ,"Well worth The wallpaper looks great! For those worried about battery life, I haven't seen any faster drain.      ",Finally. A background that actually stands out!!! I have had so many wallpapers saying that they're the best ever. They have all turned out to be all talk. This wallpaper however is 3D live and keeps on changing at your request. Love it. I don't recommended much. But this? Yup. Battery life and RAM seem unaffected and I've been running it over 2 weeks. I'm a heavy mob user also.      ,"Fantastic Live Wallpaper This is by far the best live wallpaper I've found for Android. Not only does it look incredible, but it is highly customizable and doesn't seem to have any major impact on performance on the Samsung GS6. Highly recommend the full version.      ","Thank you for an amazing update! Tongue of fire is amazing (One of your best in fact!), deep blue seems too low res on a 7"" Tablet. This is one of the best space live wallpapers on the market and this Dev does a great job supporting their apps. I own several of their wallpapers and am happy with them all. Thanks for the update!      ","I am a huge fan of space, planets, galaxies, black holes and all the like, so it is not surprising that this live wallpaper caught my interest. What is surprising is that it managed to blow my (high) expectations out of the water. Its visuals are quite simply the best I have seen in Google Play Store, with many galaxies being so absorbing that you don't really want to use your phone but just stare at the background...  The customization is good enough, with many different presets that can also be randomized and a lot of visual options to choose from. It is also worth noting that you can set an automatic timer for a background switch, which is nice if you like variety. The battery-saving options are a bit lackluster and I wish there was a way to preview how the galaxies look (the Alien Shapes live wallpaper did that perfectly). Lastly, the battery consumption of Galaxy Pack is also within reason, it will not destroy your battery % even with all the extra options turned on. Well worth the money, I hope they make a PC version some day.      ",Man.. I've had this for a long time but haven't used it in a while. Was looking for a new space wallpaper and they all suck horribly. So I downloaded this again. This one and the black hole are awesome      ,Gorgeous Live Wallpapers Love these live wallpapers. They are absolutely stunning. The timed randomizer will ensure you never view the same galaxy twice in one week. Developers also get a thumbs up for periodically adding a new galaxy every so often. There's also a thousand ways to manipulate the visuals through a host of customization options so you'll never get bored. Definitely worth the two bucks. A true 5 star app.      ,Nice but won't fully work Paid for full function version but still giving me the free one. Not cool! You want 5 stars then make sure we get what we've paid for please!      ,The best live wallpaper out there! Been using it for over 2 years! Keep up the good work. Need moar updatez!      ,"Worth It Worth every cent to support this very talented live wallpaper dev. Been using his wallpapers since my first smartphone, the original Samsung Galaxy, ~5 years ago. It was time to support him and get loads more galaxies in turn with more options than the free, individual wallpapers.      ","Brilliant On the Note 5, this extremely customizable live wallpaper sets the gold standard. No other live wallpapers come close to the versatility and beauty found here. Kudos to the developers.      ",Visually stunning! At times it is hard to keep your eyes off of these wallpapers. They have done a good job at making the visuals blend smoothly. In my opinion this is one of the best live wallpapers that you can get.      ,Amazing Images Lots of tweeks AND IT WORKS ON THE GALAXY S6!      ,Endlessly creative Looked at the free version for about 1 minute then bought the entire pack. I use this in combination with Show Off so I have no distraction of icons when viewing this moving art. The developers should be commended for real creativity.  I'm going to buy the planet pack too.  Absolutely love it!      ,"WOW!!!!! Oh new galaxies!  (aug 2015) As ever,  best live wallpapers in existence,  period!      They dont take up too much memory,  no noticeable battery drain (can slow down speed to help in options ) and BEAUTIFUL!      ", Just wow! Absolutely mesmerizing. So much to tweak too. Outdone yourself! Well worth buying!      ,Great wallpapers Any idea how to use these for your lock screen on the LG V10?      ,"Starry nights Got this years ago on a Google nexus, still works great on an S7      ","Thanks for the update! It is nice to see you tweak around with stuff. Also, can you make your other, older galaxy wallpapers compatible with modern versions of android?      ","Amazing as always! The ONLY live wallpapers I use! Long live Maxelus! I am more than  happy to pay for these gorgeous packs you provide. I love the random feature.  The planets one is awesome as well. Works very well on Samsung Note 2, 4, 12.2 and S5! Also doesn't seem to eat up the battery. I will always buy your apps! Keep up the quality work!      ","AMAZING I had your free ice galaxy on my phone all day today and every time I would open my phone I was just amazed at how beautifully done it was. I just bought the galaxy pack... reasonably priced,amazing features, and over a 12+ premades. THIS APP IS WORTH EVERY PENNY! So Excellent! I look forward to your next release!      ","Another home run Seriously man, you've done it again. I have several of this devs work and every one is fantastic. Keep making new material.      ",Always liked it Best space live wallpapers out there. No regrets here :D.      ,"I have this on all the time. Fantastic live wallpaper,  installed it shortly after buying my Galaxy Note and have yet to find anything better over a year later. :)      ","High Quality Looks great, minuscule battery usage, haven't even scratched the surface on all the options.      ",Excellent A great wallpaper that never gets old and is continually expanded upon. Well worth buying      ,My Favorite Had these galaxies floating on every phone and tablet I own.      ,Best Have been using it from more than a year. Like it always. Thanks.      ,Great wallpaper One of the best live wall papers in the market place. Works great on the Droid Turbo.      ,"StoneSour Through glass. The stars (celebraties, musicians, television, actors, Donald Trump a.k.a. Illuminati antichrist, are lying. Don't believe. Only believe in the creator that is in you. The morning star that rises in the east, and stray from the morning star that rises from the west. Great App!      ","Worth it I adore this app, definitely worth the money.      ",Excellent Using for the last 4 years. Fantastic live wallpaper      ,Terrific! My favorite LWP developer! Can't wait to see what the future holds.      ,"Not working for me I love this wallpaper but recently it has begun to show only one galaxy!!! As nice as the default galaxy is, I would like to be able to change settings and have it remember my choice.      ",Awesome ! The pros are that it looks really b.a. I love setting it on random so when I open my phone its a different galaxy to look at. I can catch myself day dreaming into it sometimes. The cons are that if you turn up the settings too much like the speed of the galaxy or whatever and your phone can't Handel it then you will feel a performance decrease. I think its necessary because it looks REALLY AWESOME! 5/5      ,Galaxy pack Best wallpaper best graphics doesn't burn battery If you set it right. Its easy. Over 15 moving background of our spectacular universe. And I'm hella skeptical      ,It's awesome You can set it to change based on a few different time selections and the wallpapers are live. It's awesome if you like space stuff      ,#1 best galaxy live wallpaper app.      ,Simply Amazing My favourite live wallpaper ever!      ,Awesome Love this live wallpaper. It's very versatile and has tons of options.      ,Love it Downloaded this about 2 weeks ago and absolutely adore it!  Love the live countdown.  Makes waiting for my trip so much fun.      ,It's magically working again!!!!! I had to reset my phone to install an update for my Samsung s5 active. Now after paying for the app my phone is no longer compatible and then it magically started working again!      ,Not live I wish I read the reviews it's not a live wallpaper. Only animated fireworks on day 0. Just use a free countdown widget and load your own wdw pick for background. Save .99      ,I love this app I love waking up to new pictures every day! it makes the time go by faster and makes waiting more exciting :)      ,"Not worth it I had the Lite and upgraded but I wish I hadn't. I can't get the walpaper due to an error at the page it sends to,and then it freezes my phone. I should have just kept the Lite for free.      ",Won't work I keep pressing instructions after I enter my vacation date.  But it takes me to a page that won't load.  Very frustrating.  Just 99 cents but still it's crap to take someone's money and it not work.      ,"No problems! This app is exactly as described, You have to change your wallpaper.      ","Wallpaper not working As soon as I enter my vacation date it tells me to add the live wallpaper, then the app closes. 0.99 wasted      ","Fits the bill This does what I wanted. I like the wallpaper feature, but it would be better if we could use our own pictures (some of theirs don't really capture the landmark well). It would even be better if the ""ribbon"" with the countdown was a widget, then we could change our phone wallpaper behind it to be our own Disney picture. The current widget is just ""ok"" in my opinion.      ",Didn't work I purchased this cause we are headed to Disney for the first time as a family. After I entered the date and time it went to say and and photo and get instructions. That site was down and wouldn't load. I know this is only .99 but I was excited for it and I feel like I wasted money      ,Waste The link given to give instructions on adding live wallpaper is invalid.      ,"Yay! Okay,  it took me a while to figure out how to work this app.... definitely must watch the video! Now that I have it working I absolutely love it!      ",What I was looking for! Nice selection of wallpapers.      ,Needs tablet support Landscape support for tablets would make it 5 stars      ,"Great app, making me more excited but would love if you put a few haunted mansion pictures, maybe one of the wallpaper, would make 5 stars with more images :D      ",Can't change picture & no fireworks :(      ,Greatly improved after they fixed website      ,I'd like it better if it didn't have the yellow blocking for the countdown. I like the one for iPhone with the wand and cloud. Also wish there were better pics of the castle      ,Why won't it stay up? :/ App. won't stay on my wallpaper. I have to continually put it back up.      ,Gamma Jules Love the countdown!!      ,App Really enjoying the app      ,Great app      ,"Love the app, but is there a way to move the banner?  With where it appears on my screen I can't always read it.....it would be better if it could be moved.  Otherwise awesome app!  Looking forward to new pics! !      ","Fried my phone Purchased this and upon phone update my phone stopped working, had to get a new one.  When I tried to put this app back on it says that it's not compatible...hence this app was the reason my phone broke.      ",Good app When will more images be available      ,"This app is awesome! I had to be connected to wifi to download, but it downloaded quickly after it started. The pictures I've seen so far have been great!      ","More pictures! :-) Hey! I love this app so much! Find myself jumping to look at my phone as soon as I wake up to see what picture the day will bring! I'm one of the less lucky ones who has a very long time to wait until my next one, this would be a 5* if there were more amazing Disney pictures  to see during the random picture option! Pretty please?        ",Great little app I really enjoy having this app on my phone. It adds a little extra magic to our upcoming trip! The only issue I have is that there aren't enough pictures and enough good pictures (some are a little on the poor quality side and some are just random scenery that are hard to tell if its in WDW...ie the armored suit.)  My suggestion would be to add some more pictures of wide shots like rides and iconic Disney locations. It's really fun to wake up and see what new picture are on my phone!      ,"Fun app It's a fun app that adds to the excitement of our upcoming trip. By having a countdown and wallpaper with Disney parks images, just adds a little touch of happiness to my day      ","Cute! I am having a problem with the bottom of the screen flashing, and it gets annoying.My mom is having the same issue. Other than that, I really enjoy it.

I purchased this app but it will not install and i do have enough space for it so i don't know what's going on.please help because i would really like this even though we only have 22 days to go i still would like to have this, for my boys to see everyday. ok fixed it and its awsome thank so much for the help, wish it had more pics but looooove it      ","Average quality graphics!! Ok, but not overly inpressed. My own photo wallpaper with the lite free version is better than the graphics that come with the $0.99 version.

Lovely App. And so true in my Suburb. Absolutely love the new update. Have a great 2016.      ,Weather display Love the app but curious how you take off the temperature display in upper left of the home screen.      ,Excellent Exceptionally interesting and original weather application! Only one data is missing: the precipitation. But it obviously depend of observing station which is not  selectable (pity).      ,"Great app Would be a 5, but backgrounds need some work.

Better than apps I've paid for!!!      ","Great visuals The developers outdid themselves. It's a beautiful app and I purchased the full version. The only improvement would be the inclusion of weather radar. In mountainous regions, the weather can vary greatly within 5 miles and radar helps plan the day.      ",Love it. When can we get some more animals or a tractor in the village?      ,So good Great update thank you .please could we have a dog or a bike.

Love this app. Would love it even more if there were a ""theme"" for my phone also. Any chance?      ",Fun app! I like the sounds! I don't care for the sky scene as it doesn't do much. Other scenes are fun and informative.      ,Wonderful app pleasant and very accurate.      ,Omg.....this app deserves 10 awesome star's this is the best weather app I've ever downloaded and now that I see this one I'm going to uninstall the old weather app. And thanks for developing this app and once again 10 star's and have a great day      ,Very neat and fun!!!

Even bought the full version. I still have another app to get radar maps and a lot more detail. Past few weeks a sliding hand appears at the top of the screen. I thought it was an indicator of updating but it never goes away. Would seem to be a bug and it certainly detracts from the beauty of the program.  Most visually pleasing weather app I've found but lacks on accuracy and diversity. I'd still recommend as it makes looking at the weather fun.      ,"FUN, INFORMATIVE, & ACCURATE! If you want a fun, informative, & accurate weather app, then this is the one to have. Always innovative & never dull (surprises everywhere). Started out with the PC version (which is awesome too!), have participated with Beta tests, & look forward to more from Pavel & Team!

The USA triumphed, and as an American child - I was proud of my nation.      ","Hosed up my phone This app was great for a while but it started slowing down my phone and it would lock up for about 10 seconds when I activated the screen so I missed calls when I couldn't answer due to locked up screen. Now this evening it ran my battery down while it was charging. Had to turn it off, now all is back to normal. Take the $2 and buy a cigar or soda.      ","Improved the quality of my life. Although the title of my rating seems over the top, it's actually true.  This is the best app ever.  I went pro only a few days after trying the free. Amazingly light CPU and battery use. (of course you should expect a little extra ) The graphics are insanely detailed & the animation smooth.   the free version is great & 100% adfree but don't even bother.  Go right to the pro version.                    .                   Would give 6 out of 5 stars if that were mathmatically possible.      ","Can't get enough of this app I cannot.believe how much fun this app is.  It s much more than a  simple wallpape, it's great entertainment.  There are so many great features, but my favorite is the ""fly-in."".  Try it, you'll love it      ","Wow again. This adds a few extra features that make this even better than the free version. You can move the moon and the earth anywhere, which you couldn't do with the free version.   One issue I did have was when it ignored the settings I put in, but I worked out that having the rotations fixed and the two finger setting box checked caused a glitch so I unchecked the two finger box and it was fine.   Best live wallpaper ever.      ","Great! This wallpaper kicks ***, I would have given it five stars if the resolution didn't cut back ever so slightly when the earth is fully enlarged. Other than that it looks fantastic on my new Note. Recommended and worth the money!      ",Stunning After a bit of fiddling I killed the stars made the Earth large and offset +fly in and with white minimalist icons it ramps up the class makes my phone n tablet look more expensive than they were      ,"Amazing app. Looks like the real thing. Some of the settings are a little confusing and can see that its going to take some time to see how they work. Would of been great to have the sun orbiting the earth as well as the moon. Brilliant graphics though. Would be interesting to have a space shuttle docking at space station with an astronaut, but I guess this would come as option extras. Keep up the good work. :D      ","Best Live Wallpaper This is certainly the most beautiful and elegant Live Wallpaper available, but it does have a huge downside. This thing eats up your battery fast, which makes it impractical for daily use as a Live Wallpaper. With that being said it's still one of the most visually appealing apps out there. It's certainly the best Earth simulator I've ever seen.      ",Hype Its looks good but why is it always dark over North America? I thought day and night would be in real time its not. Overall its nothing great      ,Great feeling Really well done. Gives a great sense of perspective and the fly-in option at startup is fantastic.      ,"Incredible LWP!! Way worth the dollar just to donate to dev for all the hard work alone! Stunning 3D Earth and Moon in HD that hardly impacts the battery, one of the best live wallpapers I've ever had! Thanks Dev!      ",No moon rotation Looks weird with the moon just sitting there...  very cool even though it hasn't been upgraded in a while and runs fine      ,Worth the .99 for pro The free version is really cool but the pro version has that WOW. I have the earth moving so slow you can't tell it's moving at first but if you look at the app icons you can clearly tell it is! So awesome and the zoom is worth the price alone! Finally have a wallpaper that never gets old because it's always different..Thanks for making this!      ,A Perfect Earth Live Wallpaper I've been using for just over a month and I'm pleased to say I have finally found the perfect positioning of the earth which I am able to lock down with the Pro Version; ( When you find a moment please increase &/or provide more options for the city lights on the dark side of the earth.)      ,"Right on the Money @ Small Change! Do yourself a favor and either pay the small change it costs to buy the Pro version or at least install the free version so you can test drive it first. You won't be sorry you've done so and if you're anything like me then you'll forget about spending untold amounts of time and/or small change continually playing around with the wallpaper cause you've quickly become bored with that last one you downloaded and could have sworn it looked better before you installed it. The setup couldn't be easier or quicker, you don't end up killing you're RAM cause you had to install a launcher too just to get the wallpaper, and the design truly brings to life the capabilities of your screen; the same capabilities you paid that extra $100 for when you bought your device so as to have the truer image, but have yet to witness the difference and therefore the value in buying the more equipped device.      ","Phenomenal Out of all the Earth simulation live wallpapers available on Google Play, this is by far the best in my opinion. It renders beautifully on my HTC One (M7) and looks very realistic if I take a screenshot of it and compare it to a photo of the real thing.  I have one feature request: the ability to increase the maximum distance of the moon's orbit to Earth because how it's displayed here is inaccurate (there's actually much more distance in scale between the two).  Anyway, great app!      ",Perfect eye candy for my tablet! All I can say is this guy Alexander is good. REAL GOOD with the parallax effects! My 3 year old Samsung tablet was becoming just another boring tablet. This just boosted its coolness factor! Spend the extra $1 to get the extra settings. You won't be dissapointed.      ,"Best wallpaper!! One little hiccup I think this is by far the coolest wallpaper I've come across, but I've found one little flaw... If my phone battery is starting to run low, less than 5% the background goes from planet earth to static, similar to TV static.  The phone continues to operate normally, which is a good thing.  Even if I charge the phone to more 40%, I must restart my phone to reset the background to mother earth once again. Just thought I should share this concern with the creator of this app. My phone Moto x, gen 2, 5.1 OS      ","Its awesome!! I wanna see sun, thunderlighting, comets and hurricanes         ",NotePro KitKat 4.4.2 Quite impressive view_ much more setting options than others_ the attainable detail level is eye striking_ you'll have an urge to explore the planet_ just do it        ,Real time effect It's the best looking earth wallpaper I have came across but I really wish there was an option in which the earth would shown in real time as in the earth is looked with fixed point as in travels around the sun and the night and day as it would look from a geostationary satellite. And I have purchased this app because I really appreciate time the effort which has put into it. I will give it 5 star as soon as that option is available. ..      ,Causes problems A really clever and interesting live wallpaper but I ultimately uninstalled it as I didn't like the constant shaking of the image as I moved my phone and the sudden transition of light to dark as I scrolled through the home screens. It also uses up a lot of RAM which can be a problem if you've limited RAM to start with and I also noticed my battery seemed to be discharging quicker than normal.      ,"Outstanding Quite simply a terrific live wallpaper that looks great and plays well with my HTC One M8. Does not seriously drain the battery,  either. Thanks to the developer for a work of art (and science).      ","Looks good...until it crashes. I had the free version & liked it so much, I went Pro. But the pro-version has crashed several times, leaving me with squiggly multicolored lines across my screen. I then have to disable & reenable for it to work again. Please fix this bug for 5 star rating. Thank you.      ",I love it. This is fantastic. I probably waste more of my battery just looking and moving my screens around now than what I did before I installed this. Really really great to look at. Brilliant wallpaper. Five stars!      ,"Bravo, Mr. Kettler I've had this app for less than twenty-four hours, and, even as miserly as I am, I pressed 'purchase'. I do not mind supporting devs who clearly have talent. My, wouldn't I love to see the code behind this gem. Hats off to you  sir!                                   ~Rick      ","Even the Clouds cast shadows!!!! I can't stop finding excuses to open my phone to stare at this wallpaper.  And it runs so silky smooth.  I have yet to check if it's a battery hogger but it's worth it.  You can also zoom in and out and rotate to your hearts content.  Seriously, this is what live wallpapers are all about.  EDIT:  Now I'm spoiled. Any chance of adding Lens Flare from the Sun?      ",Simply the best LWP!! I've tried a lot of LWP over the years and this is easily the best. The extra features in pro are well worth the money.      ,Brilliant Had the free version but wanted that little bit extra so bought the Pro version and for 99p you can't go wrong. It looks absolutely stunning on my phone and I love it.      ,"Earth & Moon In HD Gyro 3D Pro (highly recommended) I've also got the free version + I've payed for this pro version because it's that good, + I'm supporting the app administrators too. this ones a keeper. looks so lush on my motorola razr HD. 10 + 5 stars excellent!      ","Vitthal Very nice apps , I would request you to add some planets and graphics also , Again very very thanks to you sir.      ",Epic! Awesome live wallpaper. Highly customizable. The parallax effect is super trippy. I'm happy to pay 99c for the ability to change earth's rotation speed      ,"Magnificent. For one dollar, I get the trip of my life in space. The Earth and space is so realistic. Though the Earth rotates, what about the Moon, does it orbit around the Earth? Also. I wished the Earth would rotate timely with the clock. I tried setting it as slow as I could to make it rotate to match the time my country passes a day but could not synchronize it with the clock. Over all, it's a beautiful app.      ",Richard Awesome and worth 1GBP. A must have live wallpaper.  Just keep opening my phone to look at it.      ,Moon& earth I   this wallpaper live allot its a fun app its worth it having a pro   get it you won't regret it.....have a   day people.....      ,"Works perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy Light: quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU@1400 Mhz, quad-core Mali 400 GPU, KitKat 4.4.2. This is a fantastic app! As is the one for Mars. I can't imagine how much coding this must have taken to achieve the level of realism, detail, and smoothness present in these apps. Thank you for the effort. You are to be applauded.       ","Moon Earth 3D Pro is a 5star app The gyroscope,hi-definition + 3D is the best live wallpaper to date      ",Best live wallpaper I've ever seen. It looks amazing. It's a highest quality live wallpaper I've ever seen. What a great application. I'm using pro version of it and I really like it        ,"Cute does not mean dumbed down! Besides being absolutely adorable in all its little details, including the little animations in the stars or the way birds and cars and whatnot move, it's customizable enough to satify the most mental control freak and keep you entertained for a while just playing around with the endless settings, while having a good selection of pre-made themes if you just want to have a cute wallpaper out of the box. I used to be put off by the permissions, but they're just for the live weather and the moon phases (both of which can be turned off and have a ton of options - everything has a ton of options). It's been my favorite wallpaper for a while and hasn't stopped being so; I always end up coming back to it.  P.S. - I wrote this in 2014. It's 2016 and this still is my wallpaper. If I could give it 6 stars I would, just for that.      ","Like it, but needs work Really want to like this wallpaper, but it is a cpu hog. It completely drained my phone's battery overnight and constantly pulls it out of deep sleep. Definitely needs some work.      ","I love it. Got it when I first bought my phone, and have had it as my wall paper for the whole 2 years I've had my phone.      ",Excellent I'd like to have an option to automatically switch between seasonal themes      ,"I love everything about this, except that I can't be evil. Oh, how I want to poke the trees to set them ablaze, and make the cars explode, and make the birds fall dead out of the sky, and send the balloons into Hindenburg mode... Let me poke all the things!      ","Love this wallpaper! Not too fond of cars, so I don't have many. I'd give five stars if we can have more people and some (or lots!) domestic animals like dogs, cats or even cows and horses!      ",Wth!! Why doesn't the forecast ever show!!?

Like I said above, I do love Paperland. I do, however, have an issue with one of the themes. I use the Desert Migration theme and have noticed that the day and night cycle seems to be random. It doesn't show day time if it is day time outside the way it does with other themes. Hoping you can fix this bug so I can give you a five star!      ","Very nice wallpaper anyway. Problems:  1, When I change anything in the scenery or change a theme, it doesn't change. Instead I see a black home screen (as if I put black screen wallpaper there). I have to restart the phone for changes to appear and the live wallpaper to work again.  2, The weather is not accurate. I live in Zilina, Slovakia (I use custom location because of battery issues). The Latitude is 49.2228 and Longitude is 18.7400. This is correct from google and map. Why my weather doesn't show snowing / raining, when it snows / rains?  If you fix these 2 issues, I'll give you 5 stars . Edited to 1 star - the weather still doesn't work right at all. Still ""Mostly Cloudy"", even when I see that it changes in accuweather hourly weather.

But now you can no longer finds flights by flight number, only departure and arrival city. Also when you share the flight info the times aren't listed anymore. The other person has to click on a link to find out your arrival and departure times. Needs updating      ","Wonderful app! I enjoy the app! It does give real time tracking. I don't know why people give this app bad ratings but all people need to know is the real time status, flight numbers, airports, beginning flight, and destinations. No average person need to know every detail except the things I mentioned above. This app is all people need expecially if your not a tech-savvy person. My guess is mostly those who are not tech-savvy complains about the app.      ","Upgraded  from the older version when it was on special offer. The UI is improved but that where it ends. Forwarded my EasyJet flight confirmation (an airline that is on there approved list). Got an email back saying unable to update information to the app I would have to add in manually.  I did this by putting in the dates and the flight numbers etc. The departure and arrival times are completely different from the schedule and you are unable to manually amend them (I might add that Tripit had no problems picking up my confirmation email from my inbox and putting the correct information in their app).  Emails to Flight Track support go unanswered, so if you are thinking of upgrading to get all the bells and whistles I would think again.      ",Unethical developer I bought the Flight Track from Mobiata for 5$ sometime back. They have removed that from the Play store and added this instead - Flight Track 5. I'm not going to keep giving 5$ every time they change their app. It's not like they closed down... I feel it's very unprofessional. I want to also mention that the earlier version was much cleaner and better. The new version seems all cluttered.      ,Sadly this app is not reliable anymore. Just check one flight that have ben delayed 1h30 and FlightTrack is telling me it is already landed. The airport website and Google both know the update info...  Really not worth the 5$.      ,"Add flight option not streamlined In a single trip, there are two redundant options ""Add another flight"" at the bottom and a ""+"" at the top. Both does the same thing. Would be easier when selecting the bottom option to save the new flight in the same trip rather to have to ask me everytime if I wanted to do so. Since you have 2 buttons to add flight, make it easier to use one to continuously add flights in the same trip. Super annoying.      ","This is trash, unstable and unusable If you pay for something it should work.  Since I purchased this app it hasn't worked.  It no longer open.  It crashes and slows down the phone.      ",Crash This app is not working properly and very unstable when connected to Expedia's Tripdeck: Experiencing a lots of crashes when opening app on Redmi 2 android based MIUI 7.1.1 while logged to Expedia's Tripdeck.   It is not crashed when not logged to Expedia's Tripdeck. Tried hard reset and reinstalling app; it didn't solve issue if logged with Expedia's Tripdeck.      ,"abandoned Mobiata seem to have completely abandoned FlightTrack and FlightBoard, and only keep them around to swindle the odd sale from unlucky folks like myself. Do not buy.      ",It would be nice if the app could also REMIND/NOTIFY YOU TO CHECK IN the flight either 24 hours or 48 hours or even to set a specific time to remind me.      ,"Very few info in Europe. I heard this thing is amazing in the US. However, in Europe, I have inserted about 10 flights and for none of those the app could tell me the departing gate, or any other useful information really that was useful for my flight. I had to to on the airport app.      ","Force closes on S6 edge & Nexus 6 Unusable. Rebooted, reinstalled twice and still doesn't work. Refund button doesn't seem to exist. Wasted  4.

Now I can't get to the old version or my loaded flights after upgrading my phone!      ,"Add to calendar not working. Swipe to delete too easy to trigger, wish there's an option to disable it. An option for default view would also help, I'd like to keep trip histories but not show them by default.      ",Excellent flight tracking!! This is an excellent app to track the flights actually the whole trip. Getting the info about the seat map etc is an added bonus. Hope to see more features added to this app. Keep it up!!      ,"Unfinished terminal maps? Terminal 2 @ ORD, shows gate F14 as final gate, but there are more, makes me wonder about the accuracy of all the maps or if it's just that one that is wrong.      ","Mostly useless. Gate information doesn't work, and it's slow to update flight status.      ","FT5 on HTC One M9 These people are crazy, this app works beautifully.

Tripdeck is a junk feature..... ... Lazy development team...How hard can it be in 2016 to sync data between two devices? You seem to be hell bent at clinging onto ""Tripdeck"", presumably as a potential source of revenue from Expedia, whilst at the same time ignoring users who have paid twice already for this app. And you wonder why your average score is below 4 on both ios and android. 0 stars. Edit: no updates in 6 months? Given up? No loss. Enjoy my $5.

It ignores timezone for example if I send a 2 legs flight London to Bangkok, Bangkok to Krabi  they are displayed as Krabi to Bangkok and Bangkok to Krabi all GMT time. in app options are selected show airport local time      ",Worked for me Hadn't had any issues. Installed on Note 3 after I had just reset my phone to factory settings. Worked before and after the reset.      ,"Worthless Does not track flights, just draws a line between start and end point and then position by time. You would be more accurate with a paper map and a pencil. My wife's flight had a one hour diversion to avoid France. FlightTrack showed her going over France and landing an hour before she actually did!

This one offers the best interface and best features of them all.  I love how it says the flight time, and time remaining and alerts me anytime something changes in realtime.  I use this every time I go to work, plus my wife knows where I am because it syncs with the calendar. Obviously everyone involved put a ton of thought into this product.      ","Attitude of Developers seems to be an issue Many of the recent reviews for this app are quite negative and it appears the developers do not care and are simply doing whatever they please.  Meanwhile users repeatedly report bugs, removed features, etc... Yet it seems the developers still don't care.   They may respond to review comments and say they do, yet where is the proof, such as fixes and reintroduction of popular removed features??      ",Has stopped working      ,"Fun fun fun Thanks for the reply, developer. Sorry I was slow on the upgrade. Theme download options are exactly what this app needed.      ",Eh Does what it should with tailored images. Doesn't read rotation data in jpeg correctly. Doesn't support auto-cycling wallpaper.      ,"Perfect Using it for over a year now and i'm really happy with it. Does what it says and even more, the best thing it is battery friendly!      ",The quality is not what I hoped for. Most of the backgrounds are only one layer. Many of them only seem to respond to up and down motions as opposed to full rotational movement. The image quality of what I assume is the flagship theme - the nebula - is very low. The stars are poorly cut out so you see black ghosting around the edges. The only saving grace is the water droplets which seems pretty good. Unfortunately there is the occasional laggy jump - which on a Nexus 6P is very poor. Sadly I can't even seem to get a refund.      ,"G4 Hi it's stopped crashing but wouldn't download any created themes again, hi cleared app data and still crashing, yes i can see them but downloading them when it crashes.

Very well done.      ,Please have more options for customized background. It crops in too much regardless of size of the background. Would be nice to have an option so it doesn't crop and lose a lot of the image.      ,"Love this app! Lots of fun to play with, and now I have a 3d Okami wallpaper for my phone!   Be advised- to make your own wallpapers you need at least some graphics experience.  I hope that this will continue with development because there are some additional features I'd pay a couple bucks extra for. I'd like to have more than three layers. It would also be neat if they could build in some sort of blur by layer so the foreground is in clearer focus than the background.  The main thing I'd like though, is the ability to save wallpapers on my device so I can have multiple different ones to use without having to set them up every time. Or the ability to share papers with friends who also have the app without having to upload it to the gallery.

Over all I just wanna know my privacy is being respect and that the app isn't waking up and draining my batery.      ,"Awesome All the features are excellent expect the New Feature - Disguise Cover .In the Disguise Cover their will be a message will be displayed  that(For Ex.Unfortunately,Score Hero has been stopped).But it should be changed as following: Unfortunately ,Score Hero has been stopped.

Very useful to keep your device clean from junk and virus's. I use all the time to keep my phone running optimally. The developer is great at responding to my comment.

Not just suspicion on the perpetrator but also the proof needed via the ""Intruder Selfie"" action on the app that automatically takes a pic of the wicked, nosy & thieving D-bag to Use as evidence to back it up? Never assume again with this, it's just as stealthy and sneaky as untrustworthy peer. Good lesson learned 4 trespassers & they won't mess with ur stuff again.

","Very good product yet, my extreme pain is in the ads on the locked screen over which I have no control. I know that ads are how you add to your income yet, I prefer to pay than to have the objectionable ads forced upon me. The painful ads make me want to discourage our group members not to download the otherwise excellent app. Thanks.      ","Hate it Abusive permissions (camera, contacts, location, phone, SMS, storage). Possibly scareware (tactic used by criminals to convince you your device is in danger so you think app is effective; danger is fictional and app is malware itself). Also intrusive, bloated w/ useless features, spams you w/ unsolicited notifications, false advertising (takes longer than 5s to scan), suspicious reviews, causes overheating, changelog rarely updated, constant updates sometimes re-enable spy features and blocked permissions.      ","Awesome Good app... Continue your great work.... Just one issue...  Using app lock, I have added ""settings""... It got added successfully...  Whenever I open settings, it doesn't ask for password or pattern... After 3 mins, All other apps are getting locked as expected... But settings is not getting locked...  It was working fine previously.. Kindly provide your valuable comments... And we'll done for your great work...

Since the last update, there has been a delay between the AppLock showing. When I click an app that is supposed to be protected by the AppLock, it loads without the AppLock, which allows me to use it for about 5-10 seconds before the lock appears. Please fix it as this is supposed to lock an app as soon as it is clicked, not after 10 seconds. The app itself has also been laggy and slow and crashed once or twice. Please fix this app ASAP!

It uses the camera, obviously. Somehow people are suprised when they download this and they can't see their palm holding their phone. It does what I expected. The ads aren't a problem since you only use the actual app for a few seconds to enable the background. You can't open your camera from the homescreen while this background is in use, so that is a problem. I'm not gonna use this app though, because i'm sure it kills battery.

Another complain is why Apple version of the app let you watch multiple games at the same time but is not available for android???      ","constant buffering Nearly flawless on computer and Samsung phone, but absolute crap when going through chromecast/googlecast to TV. Maddening how much it buffers. I know it's the app because I have zero problems with Netflix, Hulu, Amazon or YouTube.      ","When watching an archived game, you must get rid of the ""Commercial Break in Progress Screen."" Is it that difficult to remove those and only have the game? I could watch archived games in an hour without that dumb screen. Instead I gotta wait it out for the game to come back, or fast forward which is an inconvenience because the fast forward/rewind features are not good. Please fix      ",Good but could use two tweeks Overall a great app love being able to listen live to games on phone. The only thing I would like to see tweked is that the notifications all came under the same header and only a new one pops up if the previous one was removed and also like to see an option of a notification at their end of each inning      ,"Audio keeps cutting out Does a decent job, but once an inning or so it loses the feed for about 20 second.      ","I love the app, but it doesn't scale correctly on a Nexus Pixel C.  Everything is too tall.  Please fix this by adding in black bars, or even better, but mimicking the IPad app and putting a scoreboard on the bottom of the screen and two slideout stat windows.  Why is this app still worse than the Ipad version from last year?      ","Solid but needs work The app doesn't seem to update very regularly, especially when you are navigating through it. I also listened to a full game on data when I didn't intend to.  It disconnected from my trucks Bluetooth and the audio want playing so I assumed it stopped, it was still streaming.      ","Features are great, but doesn't feel polished Same features as last year's offering, yet the application has a frustrating amount of lag while scrolling. The scoreboard list scrolls (almost) smoothly but every other part of the application stutters when scrolling. And it's hasn't been addressed in any of the updates since the start of the season. Installed on a Nexus 6P on software version 6.0.1.      ","Expect more from a pay app The interface is great, I like how you can look up stats, standing, past scores, all that stuff is great. The video highlights are nice too. But the audio CONSTANTLY cuts out. It's not due to my internet connection, it happens everywhere. I've had this issue on 3 different devices now and frankly, for an app I'm paying for, it's unacceptable. The audio player is outdated and needs to be upgraded.      ","No ""hide scores""? Great app, love the ability to stream games to my Chromecast. However...there's no option to hide scores. Seriously? You're already blacking out my local team, but when I want to go back and watch the condensed game, you show me the score? Boo :( Also, when connected to a Chromecast and you select a Condensed Game notification, it won't load with a ""game not available"" message...which means I need to go to the videos page of the app which means I've seen the score :(      ","Blackout still ridiculously used As if MLB isn't making enough cash, due to Blackout policies I have to miss Vin's last year announcing the Dodgers. Rotten bull feces you are, and I'm sure you'll continue to be.      ",5.1.3 appears to fix the app for Marshmallow. Previous fix: from adb shell: 'settings put secure mock_location 0' addressed the 'unable to reliably verify location' error message under 6.0.1. Bumping review level to 4 stars - need to hold back until testing is consistently seen across all platforms to include the newest OS releases. Good step forward though - thanks.      ,So many problems this year!! I can't watch a game or listen to a game without constant hiccups and buffering.  This is ridiculous.  Not worth the money. Very disappointing as this app has been great in past years.      ,"Maybe they'll notice in this space At-Bat premium. Best sports app no doubt. One critique is the dearth of stats available and a better roto/fantasy section. Probable pitchers? The content is on the desktop site, no reason it shouldn't be on the paid-for app. Lastly, and I've already written this in the Ballpark app reviews, but pictures from each game during checkin are not being shown when shared on FB & Twitter like in years past. It makes sharing check ins less aesthetically pleasing and complete.      ","Audio feed network error It was fine for many years, but this year, it's just unacceptable. The audio feed was cut every minute for network error. It's very frustrating. I'm using WiFi. My connection is fine. Please fix it before the season is over. Thank you      ","Tired of blackouts,  poor audio quality! Used to be excellent on audio. Now it's ridiculous! Constantly cuts out. I have changed nothing on how I stream.  Also, I live 3 hours from my  favorite team and I'm blacked out constantly when they are game of the day. I'm 5 hours from Cincinnati and constantly blacked out there as well. Completely frustrating, blackouts are a joke!      ",At Bat 2016 update is terrible The 2016 update has rendered this app useless for my Android devices. Support is also terrible. Not supported for Samsung Galaxy Tab S? Seriously? I can watch some of a game and then it will continously freeze so often that I give up watching in frustration. It won't work on my Xperia Z2 either. The list of android tablets supported is about 2 long. Ridiculous. It doesn't work either on cellular connection or via WiFi. I can only use it on my PC by leaving it out of full screen mode. I've reverted back to the old player which is thankfully still available. But I mainly bought my subscription to watch it while travelling to and from work. So I have pretty much wasted the $150 I paid. Given the support I have received via email it is obvious MLB cares nothing for its customers. Oh yes and did I mention that watching a game now uses so much data that I can only watch a handful of games a month where before the update during spring training I was watching 5 games or more a week. 60 fps is nice but I would rather be able to watch more games.      ,"Ads to loud! I've sent in a ticket for this several weeks ago and haven't heard anything. I have to play the radio at full blast to hear the broadcast. Then the ads are twice as loud and I have to turn it down. Very frustrating. If there is no change after this season, I will be unsubscribing.      ","When it works its great, when it works... Network congestion seems to be really affecting video and audio streaming. Audio will work for a couple innings and then will get hung in a choppy .5 sec loop of white noise. App become unresponsive and will not close or switch feeds. Problems occurring on Note 4 with various Wi-Fi feeds of at 20 mbps+ and cellular 4G LTE 10mbps+. Video problem occur on TiVo MLB App as well.      ",App is completely useless Paid money for a subscription.  Yay now I can do exactly what I could do for free on the website . Thank god I paid almost 30 dollars for that lol      ,"No archived audio streams If you want to catch a live game its the best way to do it, notwithstanding blackouts. BUT...Why can't I LISTEN to yesterday's game? Sometimes when driving, I would rather have the radio broadcast to catch up on games. Why is there no archive of the radio broadcasts? Even the last few days would be beter than nothing! Combined with the ridiculous ""commercial break"" with no good way to skip ahead, really just a bad app... seems lazy with these obvious flaws!      ",Terrible I wasn't informed of blackouts until after I purchased a subscription and wasn't given a refund even tho my team was blacked out... also when just trying to listen to the game it would cut in and out and was nearly 10 seconds delayed      ,Great for the most part however The problem is that I have notifications set for news and Angels alerts but I never any sound from it so basically making this feature useless. I don't know if it's a bug or what but otherwise this app would be perfect oh and I guess another thing I would want is for videos and live games to have an timestamp or something. I don't understand how this hasn't been addressed yet and I know app development isn't easy but I don't like that I have to skip around because I have no time indicator while watching      ,"Go Phillies Nice video player!  Would like to see pip support, or at least not kill video when I switch apps.      ","Excellent customer service I was having a problem watching the games on my phone. After a couple of canned responses via email, I finally got someone who responded to my emails and we went back and forth until they were able to fix my issue.      ",Dumb There's an ad played with every other video literally. The video search function is absolutely broken if you want to find a video that's more than a week old. Didn't used to be that way.      ,"I only have a few things about this app that I don't love.  I hope they can be fixed!!! IOS users get the option to rewind, fast-forward and skip to an area of a game in the app, as well as the option to hide scores so they don't open the app to a spoiler.  Android users get none of these features and I can't understand for the life of me why these features are not available for Android users!  This is a 5 star app otherwise.  I am a premium member going on 5 years and feel like Android users are getting the tail end of things by having these features neglected from the app's updates.  Please take the time to respond, even if it is to tell me why these functions can't be offered for Android users.  Thanks      ","Poor quality & lacking features I never use the android app as its such poor quality video & there are no features what so ever!  The ios app has all the info you could need & the ps4 app (I'm in the UK so had to create a USA account as apparently we British don't like baseball!)  is excellent with hd video & full pause,  rewind & highlights within it      ","Wow I don't normally review apps but this one is phenomenally made. Great interface, streams quickly and with very very few basic visual problems. Love it.      ","Fix your news notifications App is alright, and I love that it sends push notifications on my phone for my favorite team. Too bad when I select the notification the app sends me to the days scores and sometimes does not even have the story on the teams page.      ","tip top I love the app, especially when I can listen to games just out of broadcast range...I just wish there was a feature to comment on news articles      ","Gameday Live sometimes takes very long to see the next pitch or the result of an at bat. Sometimes nothing happens for a while, and then suddenly five or six pitches will show up at once, or the result of the at bat will appear. Also, I only have one notification set, for Astros news, but I always get two separate notifications for the lineup each night.      ","Android 4.1.2 does it work with At Bat? On my tablet the app ALWAYS would freeze and eventually close before the recent update. Now screen goes dark for seconds at a time and then freezes. Now with the new update, At Bat now freezes on my smart phone. This never happened until this update      ","On the Pixel C the aspect ratio is off so the games look distorted. Only provides support on 4 old tablets, no support for newer tablets.      ",Videos The game videos have not been very smooth this season. They jump to another highlight in the middle of a video.      ,Widget no longer works Love the app. Phone updated to latest Android OS and now the widget won't work.      ,"Blackout rules ruin this otherwise good app. Add audio Chromecast pls. The app is great, but as a cord cutter, I just want a way to legally watch my local games. Blackout rules make the premium subscription nowhere near worth its cost. T-Mobile gave it to me free this year, but I won't be paying next year. Also, why can't I Chromecast the audio feed?      ",Ads The old notification ads were tolerable. Ads disguised as fake iPhone lock screens (on an andorid device) are just sneaky and irritating.      ,The best keyboard app Its a cool app cuz I can find a lot of emojis and gifs. It has amazing themes and you can even personalize the keyboard  :)      ,"Y duz it need all dis info? Y, wen I tried to enable it, it sed @ enabling it meant @ it would collect evry bit of info evry fing I evr txt, including credit card numbers txt msgs contact numbers it wud record evry button i evr pressed basically! all my personal info??!!!

This helps a lot, cuz if someone's device shows squares instead of emojis, these emoticons are great and helpful, my friend has that problem in her tablet, so I use these emoticons with her!!!      ",I had kika app. For some reason my emojis went to black and white and my gifs weren't clear. I worked fine for about a month! I decided to try another one and found this one. I like it when more than the last one!!!      ,Updated emoji top bar! :-D I previously complained about not being able to customize emoji bar but you guys fixed it! Great app and cute text emojis!      ,Ok keyboard app. I like it there's just so much you can do its great      ,It's a nice keyboard It is convenient getting to GIFS and emojis easily from a keyboard menu. My only complaint is the ratio between clean modern and professional-looking keyboards to really over-the-top sparkly keyboards      ,Push ads?? Love this app but I'm rating 2* until you remove this feature. Absolutely no reason for you to have push ads.      ,"Can't get emojis under the ""heart"" Ads in one of my emoji selections and I can't get my emojis under the ""heart"" because it's all ads.      ",Best app ever It litteraly had like pointer fingers crowns everything even when its charging t says the percentage                             ,Lame. It takes minutes before it pops up.

",Too many ads and you can't close them out.      ,Feature advertised but not an option I've had this keyboard for several years and through the years I've seen bugs here and there and been fine. I can't use another one because I'm so use to it... I ran into a Facebook ad today that shows the option to use batsignals to answer calls..

WTF      ","Devices lose trust easily, disconnect permanently This app/ecosystem has poor UX and half-baked implementation. The experience of using the phone app is not fully featured.

It has worked seamlessly with my HTC One M8 up until the latest Wear and Marshmallow watch / phone updates. I am now getting ZERO notifications to my watch. I tried resetting the watch. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app on my phone. I tried giving notification permissions to individual apps. I tried creating a priority list. All I'm getting is my Google Fit reports. I'm frustrated and disappointed.      ,"Connection issues After update the phone and watch lost connection. I reset watch and reconnected, now it's connected but I'm not getting notification from apps and app watch faces aren't changing EDIT....the issue seems to be around google play services and android wear data.

Confirmed on multiple phones.      ",Crashes Worked great on my LG g and moto 360 until last update. Now my moto 360 just gives me an error that android wear has stopped making my watch useless!      ,"Disconnecting issues I have a Huawei Watch paired with a Huawei Nexus 6p, and in the last couple of weeks it disconnects a couple of times per day. I already missed some important calls because I was relying on my watch(which is expensive in Romania), why?      ","Latest release killing phone battery consumption. The last release was said to have an increase draw on the battery and they weren't kidding!  Moto 360 is destroying my MotoX Pure edition, my battery barely makes it through the day with light use...      ","Motorola 360 2nd gen After last updates, cannot start Android apps once restart. Watch gets warm and need to wait about 30mins then able to see the main screen.      ","Move ""Do Not Disturb"" menu option? The latest patch seems to have fixed many issues plaguing my Android Wear watch.  Only complaint now would be the fact the DND is now located on the first swipe down screen.  HUGE problem with this is I find my phone/watch in DND inadvertently all the time.  With the motion sensitivity turning the screen on all the time, and the new wrist flip scrolling, it's very easy to accidentally get put into DND.  Please move that option screen deeper into the selection, to avoid accidental activation.      ","Update has ruined this app Since the OS was upgraded the app crashes and disconnects repeatedly. My watch also heats up when charging, something it has not done before. Also, the battery drains very, very fast. I am using this on a Sony 3 smartwatch so it should work flawlessly! Please fix or my Sony becomes nothing more than an unusual paperweight.      ","New update now won't connect to moto 360 all the time App unstable,  ok Google not working. Why so unstable now? Basically just a watch. Last android wear I'll be getting.      ",Moto 360 1St gen notifications broke! Since update notifications stopped working making $250 dollar paper weight. I shouldn't have to roll back and kill auto update as work around. Google stop pushing out beta apps and breaking tech.      ,"Half baked 2 weeks in and it does the basics fine, but it disconnects often.  It also won't update the the Google Play software to the latest version to use all of the watch face abilities, weather and other apps that make this actually useful instead of just interesting.

The only way to get the screen on is to press the button. I have got back to Normal by doing a full reset on the watch, but to be really honest I can't say for sure what caused the problem I had just installed and uninstalled MSN fitness  and Google fit. So who knows ? Wear really needs a good accurate fitness app, what's available just dosn't cut it      ","Dislike it Not bad, but poor syncing (many old notifications on my smartwatch if I don't use it for 1+ day), no support (e-mail address below is unmonitored), sometimes doesn't connect, sometimes shows as connected when the smartwatch isn't even paired, no overall option to hide peek card, ""Watch faces"" section sometimes missing, and spotty voice recognition (just as quickly works flawlessly as it takes 15 minutes and ""endless"" tries).

Now everything works great. Google play updated AW to current version and I have not seen any disconnection or sync issue. Would rate 5 out 5 but I had to find a work around to make AW function correctly.      ,My wrist champion I have the LG G watch and with the lags random restarts I would still recommend.      ,"Kills the phone Amazing tech, and impossible to live without when it works, but lately has been crashing my moto 360. Worse, is been causing my Nexus 6p to lag pretty intensely (first time I've ever seen it lag). I know it's this app because force stopping it immediately fixes the lag. Not sure what's going on but please look into it ASAP, because the watch is unusable right now.      ","Downgrading my review as issues previously reported have gone unanswered. AW watches are no good in the rain or wet! Had to turn mine off during exercise as it was causing multiple problems (tracks skipping / device resets etc), such a frustrating experience that can be easily solved. Considering selling.      ","Sub Par Fitness Tracking Waited for Moto 360 Sport to take advantage of GPS functionality. All the apps I have used so far are very inconsistent in terms of activity tracking, especially distance tracking with GPS. I suppose it is naive of me too think that these apps would be very mature products out of the gate. Maybe in a year's time things might be better? Still, I like my new Android smartwatch and some of the features, I just wish the fitness-tracking was more accurate and consistent.      ","Please stop forcing poor updates on users I've had a LG watch for a while now  and although willing to put up with some awful updates in the past because I was an early adopter, the last one takes the biscuit. I'm tired of my watch bouncing between being amazing and then so useless, having my watch battery thrashed and then disconnecting, so no alerts and loss of functions.

I didn't like the grainy quilty of the wallpaper. It made my S5 look very cheap.      ,"Well done! Almost provides everything , run time ,fastest run, pauses when you stop or take a break, resume vice versa..this app can improve even more by adding a graphic display of pace at every second or a prequal of time.

I am not able to end my run after my run...... It showing me ""are you sure want to cancel this run?"", I also did pause the run and then I end the run .... Still it's not working.... Plz help me....      ",Nike strikes again I COMPLETELY LOVE THIS APP! I just recently began running again and was looking for an app to assist and push my goals to optimum levels! I have found that and then some in using this app! It's easy to use! If you're a pro or a beginning runner hands down this is the app for you!  Try it!         ,Great for new runner I found this app excellent. I've had knee problems in the past but have been given the go ahead to take up jogging once I keep the distances low. This app alerts me every mile I run. I aim for 2.5 miles max. I highly recommend this app.      ,"Wrong distance and speed How is it possible that I run more distance in same time and my speed goes down?  Please fix this bug or else my hunt for a good tracking app continues.  And wait,  I am in India but the store prices are in dollars.

I logged back in smoothly but changing fb accounts isn't going so smooth. It will find my account, let me log in and then show the ring of death until I back out of the log in. Please fix this.      ",Close to perfect Only complaint is that it can't access your Google music collection. Otherwise this app does everything you might want and more.      ,"Ok but... You suggest split times in some of the coach section descriptions, but don't offer any way to set up (or alert on) those split times      ","Good but lacking for Samsungs It'd be a 5 star if I could use my own picture when posting my times, like you can on an iPhone. Instead of only being able to see my route.      ",Adds random miles to my runs Was loving the app until today. Ran 4 miles and activity clearly shows this but home page has jumped me an additional 15 miles! Now I feel it's ruined my progress as I cant clearly see my actual milage increasing as it has these random ghost miles included... Update it has just added another 20 miles while sitting at home. My profile is now ruined and I have achievements I didn't earn Uninstalled!!!      ,"Limited functionality for Android S6 I loved this app when I first started using it because it had many functions I was looking for. However, by my 6th run, I was having issues with the mapping. Sometimes it would work ok, other times it could work for part of the run then stop even though total distance kept calculating. I didn't change any settings on my phone. Since I did a software update for my phone, the mapping function isn't working at all. I get a pace graph instead. All settings are correct but not working. Switching to a diff app.      ",AWESOME APP!! Really motivates you .Let's you go at your own pace and let's you set your goal.I am usually not a cardio fan.But now I love it!!      ,Pros: Easy to set up and start running. Good post-race feedback. Tracks how many km you have on your current shoes. Friend tracking. Cons: Does not show average pace during run. Does not work well with GPS on Nexus 6P.

I was already having problems setting the dates, bcuz it kept resetting itself to a different date other than I put in. I had to keep adjusting it. Finally I got it put in & I triple checked to make sure it was right bcuz of the mishaps. Now the date was correct for 3 days, then come Saturday it sent me a msg saying I had 2 DAYS left! Wth! Tried to edit, but can't.      ",Its a nice app. Just had 3 runs so far. Apart from other details it would be great if it has a weather feature also. For example it should show the run was done under what weather current weather conditions and what was the location temperature or humidity factor etc      ,"Burning the extra energy Do the push aways, get away from the computer, Dig those running shoes out, and make it happen. You'll thank yourself for the effort.      ",Best running app ever Only issue I have ever is the auto pause doesn't disengage when you start running again. Other than that it's a must-have for any runner.      ,"Motivating! New to the app, getting started running again and I find this app very motivating, and it pauses when you pause so no cheating!!      ","app sucks The app used to work now it says access denied! why the f**k you developers keep updating and f**k up the apps! if it not broke leave it, no need to go version 2.3.2.1b whatever when version 2.0.0.0.0.0 works!!!      ","Garbage I just completed a 16 mile run, and Nike+ decided to subtract it from my monthly total, and add 4x that distance to my overall total miles. It does the same things when trying to track shoe mileage. This app cant even do basic math (you know, a major part of its job for tracking run mileage). Im fed up with this garbage app.      ","Functional It should include the IOS function to share with a photo for the android devices, only feature missing, other than that it's pretty accurate not to mention stable.

I can see my run activities from garmin correctly in nike+. While Garmin bike activities (correctly) do not appear as activities in Nike+.  A bike activity of 20km in garmim appears in the Nike+ Challenge as distance run! Obviously this should not happen.    I am unable to edit or delete this bike 20km distance in Nike+ challenge.   Should I use this bug to ""run"" 42.2km in 2:03 on my bike each weekend and ace the challenge? :)      ","Not working at all It says 'service unavailable , try again ?'.

Time is right but the splits will be wrong. It will say when I finished it was way faster than the actual finish time.  For example did a race the other day 5 miles inn1:27 but the splits said i did 5 miles in 1:18. The overall time was correct and it was right at 5 miles so where did the extra time go???? Frustrating the splits being off since I am trying to see what my miles are and I can't with this not working.      ,"Great app. Love that they moved FB/Twitter share nonsense to appear AFTER the run, and the new ""end run"" button works much better in the rain than the old slider.      ","Motivation I've always liked to run but with this app it pushes me to work even harder, everytime I hear it say ""beginning workout"" my body just gets in gear and takes off. Just got the app recently and would definitely recomend it to anyone who enjoys running or wants to start!!      ","App keeps you motivated Add this app to s health on the Samsung Galaxy phones.   Scroll through the settings, add count down 30 seconds (gives you time to put the phone away), sync your music, change the interval updates to .5 miles, add your sneakers etc.... Those are settings I liked.   I gave it 4 stars because I had to uninstall a few times over the last 8 months (giving the wrong distance even after recalibrating).

Does anyone know where those mystery runs came from because they arnt logged down any where.      ,Nike App Run slow at times can't get to my friends list and freezes a lot. Please fix. Sincerely a Galaxy Note user!      ,SO SWEET!!!! Wasn't impressed for the first couple of years but Nike has done a great job of improving this app over time.  It's awesome now. Thanks Nike!!!      ,"Good App Can't take pictures during my runs like others can, still no option to share on instagram for Android. STILL Wish there was an easier way to search for friends. Putting in someone's full name, not having them come up, and having to scroll through all with the same first name only is tedious. Also wish there was a way to edit the shoes you add. Runs seem to be dropped for no reason right in the middle of a route.  adding mile splits would significantly improve this.      ",#Nike+ gives incorrect data The recent updates to the app sucks. The app gives incorrect distance vs. Speed data. Even more annoying is the #Nike+ plus Twitter support. I gave them so much data to diagnose the error but such a waste of time!      ,Doesn't track well It seems to pay more attention to phone jostling than my actually movement. I don't bounce much as a runner and it keeps telling me I've stopped running when I have not. Map my run treats me much better. Very unhappy with this app but it's just not for me.      ,Loved it! The app is awesome. But one thing I noticed that it shows miles ran faster than the outdoor mode while it's indoor mode. Didn't get it why!      ,"Almost perfect Sadly although i loved this app will have to move on as i purchased a pair of jabra pulse headphones and there is no support for HRM's.  I really loved this app as well as it is perfect in every other way.

The doctor's replies are always helpful, educated and thought-through. Thank you health tap.      ","Terrible service & advice The doctor was completely unhelpful, from a medical standpoint. His medical advice amounted to try not to worry about it. When I was unsatisfied, they refused to refund my money, despite my calling to cancel in the first 24 hours.

You could ask a question too a doctor (for general knowledge, of course), and get a concise answer. Now, you get doctors who seem to be in it just for the incentive, providing useless answers. I've even had one doctor call me a liar about a diagnosis that was made by 8 separate independent medical examiners and several orthopedic doctors and surgeons. What a putz. It seems that doctors now don't care about the answers they give on there. $$$      ","Septic g.f. ended up going to ER b/c no one from HealthTap called her back. My girlfriend found this app &liked the free version, so she tried the pay version.  She was having horrible kidney pains& back pains.  She messaged HealthTap.  She waited....And waited...And still waited. NO DOCTOR HAS YET TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO CONTACT HER IN DAYS. She ended up going to the emergency room B/C she was septic.

I find it facinating that these healthcare  professionals take the time together answer each and everyone of the questions that each individual asks.

","Almost perfect Love this app! but it could use a few improvements. It's a bit tricky to find the free question option on the homepage. It's also really hard to ask a question in 150 characters! It should be extended to like 200 so you're not forced to abreviate-which doesn't let you fully explain your question, and then the doctor doesn't know the whole story. Sometimes the doctor will also give you a really short answer that isn't helpful. But overall this is a really great app.      ",It says you can ask a doc a question for free but NOTHING is free on this app!!!  I could see a doc in person for these prices.  They are ridiculous!!      ,Disappointed I have no idea why I had to pay $49($44 Australia) or why I couldn't see what I was paying in Australian dollars before I paid as it just took it straight out .

Pity it doesn't work properly.      ,"Didn't need the last update. Unlike many other users with hundreds of thousands steps per day I have an opposite problem - the updated app on my phone doesn't bother to count any steps I made. Instead of some reasonable thousands I see a couple of dozens. Useless. It's a pity, because I've been using the app for more than two years, and now have to uninstall it.

Would also like to see distance in km that I have walked.      ,"Last update rendered this app useless Now counts 500 steps for every 100 taken. Tried rebooting, but no change. Sad.

Walked almost nothing yesterday but got over 7000 steps.      ,No stars. Because it no longer works. It used to be great. Now it incorporates the microphone in its 'collection' of data and your phones vibrator adds 1000's to your daily total. Developers don't listen to the crowd so I'm bailing out.

Wtf have you done!? It was never the best for accuracy but this is ridiculous. Update is for ""bug fixes and usability enhancements"" you say...I say ""make sure the bloody thing works first!"" Update made bigger bugs and there's NO usability! Give yer heads a wobble and sort yourselves out! PS...Apparently I've walked 1.1million steps today. RIDICULOUS #frombadtoworse      ",Very poor I am uninstalling this app.  It works very poorly.  Short walks (like at home in the house) either do not register at all or inaccurately.

",Fast and accurate on note3 You can feel the side of your neck and feel the same beat as your camera is measuring from your finger so anyone can check their accuracy doubts by doing the same with their device      ,"My Galaxy Note 4 got extremely hot when I tried using it, locked up my phone as well.  Uninstalling!      ","Problems with Google Fit It would be a 5 stars app if the measures will be recorded in Google Fit, it just doesnt record the measures. It would be nice to have an option to set when you want to start the measure not just autoplay. The design could be slightly better but thats ok.      ","LOL Cool graphics and makes you believe it works - sure it measures your heart beat, but the number you get is wrong! Have taken my results from this app and used both a brachial and carotid artery  pulse check, and both are nowhere near the number given by this app. The app works, sure, but it doesn't give you accurate results. Stick to checking your pulse using a stopwatch....since you're reading this on your phone anyways.      ","My doctor recommended this application After a trip to the hospital with a rapid heartbeat I was afraid of a repeat performance. My doctor showed me this app on his phone and I downloaded it in his office. Now I can monitor my heartbeat and know when to be concerned.  Only gave it four stars because of the ads, although they are the least anoying of any app I have.      ","It works, but the flash light hurts. This app is great and the idea is awesome. But there is problem. Keeping the finger so close to the flash light which is constantly on definitely hurts.      ",Autonomic Disorder! I have Dysautonomia which causes a racing heart. The app will not correctly clock anything in the triple digits which I find aggravating because mine usually is! Kids love it though and it works for them!      ,"Really works I'm a registered  nurse and I have compared the results with my own pulse rate and rhythm  and ""yes"" it is accurate. I have an arrhythmia so I monitor myself  frequently.      ",Wildly Incorrect Had my heart rate checked by a nurse 15 and 10 minutes before using app - both times it was 113. The app said I was at 68.      ,The App Works Well and I used to use it so much that I bought the upgrade. Sadly when I did the same with my cell phone the app didn't make it. Now I'm back to the free one. A downgrade. Boo. Plus there isn't an obvious way to contact the company about it so....now you know.      ,"Okay if you are not moving. Why cant I get a HR while I am running? Does anyone else have this trouble? Great for resting heart rate but ever since I have used this app its never worked for when I am working out/moving : bicycling,  running even walking. I have to stop then it takes so long to get a reading my heart rate has lowered which misses the point. Anyone else have these issues? It happens on android and apple phones      ","Works well Easy to use, accurate, but ads are really annoying as they pop before you can focus on actual results. Paying for ad free is worth it if plan to use for more than spot checking HR during exercise or to determine resting HR      ",Does not work It gives random numbers. One minute my heart rate is 60 the other minute 120! And the flashing light really hurts!!      ,It works All these skrubz bitching about how it doesnt work -_- works fine for me gave me a rate of 77 bpm I checked my pulse for 15 sec and got 19*4=76 its been pretty consistent for me.      ,Nice app Surprisingly accurate. (Compared results with Polar heart rate monitor).        The scanner sometimes gets stuck trying to identify a reliable pattern.      ,"Works good enough It does give a very good indication of ones heart rate. I do not take it for 100% correct, but it is very close. Perfect to check heart rate for general tracking (I use it to check if my heart rate is not going out of rhythm).      ","It really does it I wa.s skeptical using it. But when i did, it really did work. I dont know if it really is actual but yeah i can see my finger's color popping red and light red so i guess it really works      ","It works well, but the ads are intrusive. It works great, I've compared it to a lot of other devices and it is accurate. I don't like the intrusive advertising, especially when showing the app to others.      ",Useful Whn you're on the go this is useful i have a friend with heart problems i recommended him this and he is using it ever since      ,"I know it works because... When I relax and took my pulse five times I got around the same result ,but when I hold my breath the results changed, my heart rate begin to drop. My heart rate is a 72 when I'm relaxing and when I hold my breathe it drop to a 67. But they need to step their game, and add more stuff other than the fact that you can check your heart. Wow!      ",Handy and Accurate App. A very useful and much needed app. I compared it to a regular wrist blood pressure / heart rate cuff and it is accurate within 1 or 2 bpm. Highly recommend!      ,"Works as advertised, droid turbo Not sure about the google sync issues I don't have that, gives consistent and accurate reading, is pretty spot on between the old fashion method with finger to wrist. I will be using this to track my morning resting HR to track workout recovery      ",Doesnt work! How can it keep ranging from low then high! And i had it on my couch didn't it can have pulse.  The only accuracy you can is if you buy a partable bpm machine. Or doctor vist not from an phone app      ,Sync issues - Google Fit sync only happens if you do a second heart rate check. I'll buy the app if the developer fixes Google Fit sync. The same issue has been reported with the paid version.  Advice:  Don't put your finger over the flash -- it hurts. Just put your finger over the camera lens.      ,Seem To do what it says. Can't expect it to be as accurate as the strap but seems to be in the range as far as my heart rate goes. Was going to update to the paid version but that hasn't been updated in a very long while and this needs updating also.      ,Accurate I compared resting heart rate and workout hear rate with my cardiology readings and they matched within 2 to 3 beats. But sometimes when I do more vigorous workouts it's useless.      ,"Disappointed :( Downloaded it to use for a science fair project.  Appeared to work first time.  After that it starts counting down the 10 seconds then jumps back to 10 seconds...I can stand/sit for a minute and it just keeps doing that: 67bpm...71bpm...then 55bpm...and up to 79 etc...same thing on three other family members (they gave up waiting).  I have tried not pressing too hard, different finger position.  Doesn't matter.  Too inconsistent for what I need it for.      ",It's Great It might be a toy. To some? But I did a follow up with my BP machine and it hit it's mark. Plus it will help me keep track for my doctor! So yes get the download.      ,"Works great Very accurate,  i have an s5 that has a dedicated heart rate sensor and this one which uses the flash had basically the same reading so that tells me this works.      ","Lens gets hot The lens gets really hot, don't know if that's good for us. Also it sometimes gets stuck during the measuring process and never finishes the countdown to 0s. Good app but there's room for improvement.      ",I was in the middle of having a mini stroke and it gave me a normal heart rate. Take your finger away and it still reads. It's a fake      ,"The Best Every fitness guru needs this app. I love how quick and simple it is, with no annoying $$$ or signing up for an account. Definitely a handy device! (No pun intended).      ",Its awesome. But dont go pro. Really helpful!!!!! Keeps u motivated. Although going pro doesn't add anything new to this app. So stick to the free version. And it keeps crashing every now and then.      ,Great app for tracking activity Great for tracking my parkruns. Helps maintain motivation. I run on an old smartphone so I don't worry too much about rain or mud! Would like it to auto start my music when I start an activity. #LittleStokePark #NoSurrender      ,"Full Featured and Easy to use I can track bicycling, running, indoor workouts, and walks.  Gives inspiring analysis of how I'm doing against my historical workouts.  Update to the UI is nice, and it has a more modern look now      ","Great tool, simple to use Very straightforward and easy to use. Works perfectly. This definitely makes seeing your progress very easy.      ",Sorry could not connect to RunKeeper This is all have been reading for last couple of days. Overall a great app but  these repeated error messages are getting on my nerves.      ,Best running app! They keep getting better and better!      ,"Fantastic app and simple to use I am trying to improve the distance I can run and time I'm doing, so finding this app very helpful in tracking my training      ",Very useful This application provides all the basic information needed to monitor results of workouts.      ,Missing manual lap function. Would be nice to have vibration as choice instead of audio feedback.      ,Love using this for my walks and bicycle rides. It tracks to my fitness pal too. Bonus.      ,Thank you! Couldn't be any better free version! Thanks again :)      ,"It gives wrong data in terms of distance This has been a  problem since last 2 months, you pause an activity walk for say .50 kms , resume activity and these .50 kms will be added in your activity.. Also if you keep the phone in pocket gps doesn't track the activity and distance gets less...      ","So far, so good Only used for 1 run so far ... seems fairly good      ","Reliable, easy to use Had to uninstall and re-install as the latest up-date messed with my GPS. Since re- installed works perfectly.      ",Just make some changes like strava social      ,A very good running out the keeps track of your all your runs      ,"Works great I love using this app, it is very simple and helps me to make and keep goals weekly. There are little challenges, and you can share on social media if you'd like. Make sure to let the app run for a minute when you first turn it on so the GPS works properly.      ","Very disappointed How can I run 5.25km,you register 0.34km      ",Got me running!! Probably this is the app I had been waiting that was destined to get my lazy butt running.... Great job guys! Will see if I should buy one of your plans if I don't improve much...      ,Runkeeper IS a keeper! I love this app when I'm running outdoors. It is accurate and easy to use. It also nicely tells you when you've been inactive and encourages you to get back on track.      ,Ottimo Con un buon GPS si sa realmente la propria attivit       ,Great app I use this app every day.      ,Pretty good Swapped from mapmyrun after it stopped syncing some runs. This has been faultless so far. Like the reporting options on the website      ,"Perfect tracking in all departments, so reliable.      ",Awesome running app The best running app by far      ,Great application I love this running application.  I'd like to see more integration with music library to be able to control my running music without having to switch apps mid run.  I'd like to see my pace shown on the map visually to see where my show points are instead of having to guess.  Thanks.      ,Favorite app! Love that it tracks everything!      ,Great app Can't live without it          ,Very useful app Just go for it...      ,"Droid turbo Not always so accurate, somewhat expected      ","Cannot add images I run using Garmin watch. After the activity is synced from Garmin to Runkeeper, I cannot add images to the activity.      ",Awesome! Ties in with mapmyfitness too      ,"Great Fitness App. Great for tracking multiple activities, fitness and progress.      ",Great run tracker! The gps works great with my Samsung s6. Shows all my stats like distance and times with grafts. Easy to turn on and go.      ,"Simple and motivating Great to track outdoors stuff, easy manual entry for indoors activities too. Keeps me on track      ",Best run app around. Very accurate I use it all the time.      ,Great app Easy to use.  Multiple options and settings to customize the experience!      ,I use it quite a lot      ,Now I can spinn      ,Great For Running Love it.....tracks my runs and gives me great feedback!      ,"Marathon here I come! In the past year I have dropped 100 lbs using clean eating by calories & macro balance on MyFitnessPal and running and exercise tracking on MapMyFitness. I run my 2nd marathon in a few days and feel great!  Thanks for helping a middle-aged, obese male feel like his twenties again!      ",Tried it The map (gps) portion did not work.  It left off 2/3 of the walk.  We walked about 3 miles and it only log 0.9 miles with a different route.  Not sure what to use it for if your figures are inaccurate.      ,Good for mapping but you have to stop and select each activity type as you go which makes it a bit cumbersome when running then walking on the same route. Going to try this out a bit longer before deciding if I'll switch back to Fit.      ,Awesome Great app! Any way you can update to add P90X3 & Focus T25 or Body Beast?      ,"Underarmour  is lit I've used alot of fitness apps and by far under Armour app is the top go to pick for me it's intuitive and super easy to use and it calls out your milage and pace which is genius since you don't need to stop and manually check I highly recommend this product to anyone who hikes,walks,freeruns,and runners my one and only gripe about this app is that it scares you when it calls out your data other than that it's amazing      ",A very well-rounded app I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 4.  It tracks you very well in the way that it indicates.  The food / nutritional section is not user-friendly. You try to be pacific as possible with food descriptions/vendors and it gives you something that you didn't describe so you try again and sometimes again ... frustrating. I gave up on it. It could have some other tools that you use and don't  have to pay for.   I would hate to buy this app and have other disappointments. But overall the apps not bad.      ,"Just an update from my last review below. Walgreens will no longer link to MapMyFitness. I think the MMF app is great. You can check out your history for over a year and you get weekly, monthly, and annual updates as well as occasional ""fitness flashbacks"" for special achievements, all with the free app. I do think the workout types available have been reduced. Just lately I've been having difficulty with the app pausing and restarting in the middle of a walk. I'm attempting to uninstall and reinstall to see if that helps. Finally, I wish the logout was one easy step from your workout. You have to go back to a menu screen and go all the way to the bottom to find logout. Overall still terrific.  Walgreen's revamped their Balance Rewards for healthy choices and can link with devices and apps, including Map My Fitness that covers everything. I've been using it for over a year and think it's great. They've helped me out when I had problems with the Walgreens sync and I love the weekly feedback. Map just got taken over by Under Armour and I've had problems with the app forgetting my password even after it reset. I just uninstalled.and reinstalled and it was fine but an annoyance.      ","5 stars for a great application! I use Mapmyride but it's the same thing. I had one problem with it, the GPS wouldn't map me correctly but I asked for help and got it from their service people (who did a great job.) DO NOT use any power saving settings on your phone and it will map perfectly. I love that it keeps me informed while I'm working out so I know how many calories, how far etc. I can't say enough good things and I use it for free. I have this connected to Myfitnesspal and my UP3 health band and it all works pretty seamlessly together.      ",Great app Easy to use and very helpful app. I gave 4 stars only because it's lack of my favourite roller-blades skating.      ,Live and breathe by it I've used several over 15 years of being a fitness enthusiast. The connectivity with other apps and services makes this indispensable.      ,"App connection is awful I've been fighting with connecting UP, MapMyFitness, and MyFitnessPal and it's awful. The app can't handle a pop-up that takes it out of focus and retain it's state on resume. So if you have multi-factor authentication enabled for FB, don't expect things to work well for you if that's the claim you like to use as your authentication method. Aside from that, it keeps telling me that my info for the other apps is incorrect. I just kept doing out over and over and eventually one worked. Maybe if I keep at it..      ","Excellent, the only app you'll need for all your workouts This has been a great app. I like it because I do wide range of exercises and sports, and I like it that I can track all of them with one app as well as record my bike routes and running routes via the GPS feature. The auto pause feature makes tracking the actual time moving a breeze. My only request is that they add an option under Activity so one can enter in their own custom options. Sometimes I find it limiting what pre-loaded Activities are available to choose from. Otherwise I'd rate this app 5 stars.      ",Good when it works It worked great when I first downloaded it but the nutrition side of it stopped working me which is annoying. But other than that very good for keeping track and motivated.      ,"OK but I've had some issues The app in itself is good but I've had various issues from the beginning: (1) I couldn't login via Facebook as it offered because it just kept going back to the login screen (2) It has shut down randomly a few times when I've just started working out (3) It doesn't always communicate with MyFitnessPal as to the correct kilojoule/calorie amount burnt e.g. MapMyFitness says I've burnt 200 calories, but in My Fitness Pal it days a significantly lesser amount has been burnt (this could be issue with MFP though)      ","Inconsistent I like the app and use it a lot but if I run the same route, the distance can be (isn't always but can be...) off by a fair amount.      ","Works for me Provides features I need to track distance, pace, and variety of workout formats. It may have ability to give me course directions on the go when I want to run or bike a predetermined route, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet.      ",Excellent Great app easy connection to other apps & fitness trackers easy loading...no complaints as of yet.      ,Great way to track your fitness. Great app to track and share your fitness activity. Good way to challenge and motivate friends to get active.      ,"Inaccurate I walked 4.4 miles and 56 mins and the app said I did 1.2 miles and 25 mins,linked it to Bounts to earn points,obviously they don't want to give out to many      ",My new trainer MapMyFitness is a great way to keep up with what you are doing and help you push yourself harder.      ,No issues with Mapping or Logging of my walk on this occasion (1st time using this app). I'll give it a month and add more comments. But 5 star for now.      ,Used to work well but now GPS stops 5 mins into a run and doest track properly      ,"Mapping My Fitness Great Fitness App which is a good aid for gauging your fitness progression. App has been malfunctioning by not letting me see activity feed or suggested friends, Im uninstalling then reinstalling      ","Simply awesome, This app helps me track my activities like none other I've tried before, connectivity is the key for me,  I love it!   updated version is even better! Using it over a year now and I love it still just as much!      ",GPS no longer working Update: gps is no longer working since I upgraded to an s7. No longer accurately tracks my walks. Very disappointed use to love this app.      ,Will not sync to misfit Claims to work but fails to connect and just sits at loading screen      ,"It works Works nicely , I just wish it wouldn't keep asking for reviews when I have already reviewed it.      ","Perfect for keeping me in line :) A great app with a rewards incentive for keeping to workout plans and challenges. Keeps you in line with times and logs workouts, GPS system is right on the button. The best app I have in my phone 5*****      ","Easy to use Easy to use, my favorite app for tracking hikes and walks. I even use the map on trails as a guide so I don't get lost lol. Great app!      ",Great App Easy to use and very motivating. I love it      ,Gps On a high school track 1600 meters is a mile but the app says 1400 meters is a mile so I dont trust the distance at all but I like the training plan and the pro version is free is you have a anytime fitness membership      ,"This is a great tool to measure and track.   I also use it to get  walking/riding/rucking routes in parts of the world that are new to me.   Syncs pretty well, although calorie burn doesn't translate well.   I have noticed that fitbit will pick up workouts from this app in real time, but fitbit won't take workouts that are logged after the fact.      ",Perfect for me I love this app because it makes it easier to track my fitness goals. I am now able to focus on performing at my best rather than keeping times and trying to figure out my speed.      ,Just started using this app and love it already. No more guessing how I did!      ,Flexible Connectivity Calorie calculations for a vast array of cardiovascular activities and automatic linkage with My Fitness Pal.      ,Great app Have been using this mainly for walking but love it. I like when it tells you how far you have fone and the calories you have used.      ,So far so good Just used it for forst time. Seems pretty accurate      ,Nice App Gave 4 stars because there's always room for improvement!      ,"If dont have it you gots to get it Tracks distance, time, calories burned, avg speed and elevation changes awesome app      ",Accurate and easy to use Have used this app for a long time and think it is excellent.  Love how it syncs with my Jawbone Up 3.      ,Lacking It is very hard to find foods served in restaurants. I always have to use another app to find the foods and value.      ,"Super easy to use. I like that I am becoming aware of the calories I eat. Even if I'm over goal, it teaches you which foods are monopolizing your calorie budget. They have an extensive database of restaurants and their menu items; So, if you eat out, it is easy to find your meal when you aren't able to scan it.      ",Thumbs Up!!! So far I deleted all of my other weight loss apps and find this app the best. Very organized accurate and motivating.      ,"Ad placement on new update I know you guys need to make your money and I've been using your app since WAY back when you guys first came out and have enjoyed this app immensely, but your ad placement is getting out of hand. Placing an ad on the top of the log page is SO annoying and highly distracting. It also seems to re-load at a pretty constant rate which leads me to think it's using my data unnecessarily. Be creative with your ad placement and not look like you only care about us a revenue source.      ","Ads / overpriced subscription I've been a user of this app for a long time. I understand the need to monetize, but it's starting to get a bit out of hand. Premium is too expensive, and now there are ads cluttering up the UI. Not a good move.      ","Great app! It took a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it this is a great app! It is easy to use & a very effective weight loss tool. I'm already down 29 lbs.      ","My favorite health app!  It has been very useful to me and my health goals.  I love that you can make recipes that combines ingredients and divides it into servings, helping out the home-cook!  It has an extensive database, part of which is crowd-sourced.  Crowd-sourcing does have its downfalls (sometimes items are inaccurate), but this app compensates by allowing you to edit food details, for instance, after scanning a barcode.  Sometimes it lacks restaurant items, but you can enter a custom item (such as something you looked up on google) and that is good enough for me.  The custom options really make the app!  Besides those benefits, this is the one app I love updating.  The team actually writes what is being improved in the ""what's new"" section, making it seem like someone actually cares and is working on real problems.  The developers seem to actually listen to complaints and FIX the problems!  Keep up the good work guys!      ","Better than MFP I definitely find the UI and UX better than MFP. Easier to use, more intuitive, better looking, less obtrusive ads and sponsored content. Only thing missing is Garmin connect communication! Definitely bump up to 5 stars with that functionality.      ","Great App Love this app. Downloaded after reading bad reviews about weight watchers. It is easy to use and lots of great features. My favorite is the barcode scanner. It makes it easy to add the calories onto my daily log. I also love that I could link my activity tracker to the app. It adds my calories earned from exercise. So great. Download it, you won't regret it. I am thinking that I might purchase the premium app based on how great the free version is.      ","After 3 attempts to resolve the problem...linking with Google Fit ""breaks"" the app.  You lose the ability to scan or manually search for foods to enter and the app locks up.  The developers are aware of this, but my last email response stated that they hadn't identified the ""glitch"" so they can't estimate when it will be resolved and to keep an eye on updates in the Google Play store.  As a paid subscriber that only paid for the sync ability, I'm not happy.  They extended my membership 2 months as compensation, but that was 2 months ago and the app is still not working.  If I have to use an app that won't sync with Google Fit I might as well go back to MyNetDiary since it has far superior Diabetes tracking and reporting.      ","Good app This app kept me accountable for my 30-lb weight loss, and continues to be the best thing I have done for my health. I like the layout and ease of use, and as a result, I've never lost motivation to log my food everyday.      ",Love it! This app really keeps you on track.. It's super easy to use and when I do follow it.. I Lose weight! I have recommended it to several friends! I think there are a few minor bugs with sending friend invites and I wish you were able to post pictures in the comment field . especially for the challenges. . All in all.... GREAT APP!      ,"Could be better for android Easy to use food tracker, but doesn't sync with samsung gear, so it doesn't recognize my steps.  Food calorie counts with Android seem off in many cases. Worked much better with my IPhone.      ",Excellent program After I found how to work with its unfriendly interface I was amazed how powerful is it. There are complete list of foods and dishes including international. Thank you for this awesome software!!!      ,"Love the interface! I used to track calories with MyFitnessPal, but I found the interface on that app cumbersome and difficult to use. I really like the interface on Lose It!      ","Good app, bad localization for Android. This app is rather intelligent, but fails 3/4 times to let me search up my entries on strong 50 MB WiFi. Please fix.      ",My last diet i used my fitness pal. These are the best 2 apps for diet control and i suppose it would be personal preference between the two.      ,"Good but errors I cannot change So having to uninstall. Confused, it asked for my weight etc at the startup, once on the app it's telling me I weigh 13kg that's TWO stone so I need to eat 3000 calories a day. I entered the correct weight, it won't let me change it or I can't find an option to do so in all of the settings. If that part was cleared up then sure it seems like a great app with the pie charts and calorie search/goals etc      ",Buggy This is extremely buggy.  Search doesn't work.  Can't pull up right foods. Repetitive foods and many have different calorie counts.      ,"Love it! I cannot say enough good things about Lose it. I recommend it (highly) to anyone who wants to safely lose weight at a healthy rate. Even the ""free"" app is pretty darn good if you ask me. Much better than other weight loss/activity tracking apps I have tried. Thanks Lose it!      ","Keep track and lose as much as you want Love this, I've done well with this app. Gonna go strong again!      ","Not quite as user friendly as other aps I've been using Noom for about a year,  and functionality of the two aps are nearly identical. I tried LoseIt as it works with the Microsoft Band 2. However, LoseIt is a far chunkier UI (compared to Noom) and it's food item search is intolerably slow,  both with on line wifi and offline. On the plus side,  it's recipes are better, and it's integration with the Microsoft health service strong.      ",Half done I dont need to lose weight i need to gain it i like the food tracking portion of this app but unfortunately it isnt geared towards my health goals of gaining weight hopefully you guys consider not everyone is over weight some people are on the opposite side of the spectrum      ,"Works for me! But... This app has been useful to me for two years+ in logging food. However...now less user-friendly, more complicated to enter foods and barcode button located too close to other feature. Using Android on phone.      ","Incorrect information Has nice some features. Soon as I downloaded I scanned several items in my kitchen...unfortunately it was incorrect on the calories on several items, and not by a small amount. Being several hundred calories off in a diet app makes it hard to trust.      ","Great! I love that you can use the barcode to log calories....what I would love to tweak, would be logging excersise calories burned, because there is a differnce in your number to what I abctually burn. I would love it if you were able to change the number and allow you to type in notes like cardio trainer app. I went from a 4 star to a 3 star due to me switching from a fitbit to a Garmin Vivofit HR and lose it does not sync with Garmin products, super dissapointing.      ","Great App but it's frustratingly slow at times I switched from Myfitnesspal app to this. I like it overall but when searching the food database, I find it to be way too slow. There should be an option to download the food database to the app and for it to update the cached database automatically. This would speed up searches greatly and I believe fix my issues.      ",Not accurate always Sometimes when I log food it doesn't add it to my daily total and says I have eaten less calories than I have. For example yesterday it only counted my breakfast even though I logged lunch and dinner and snacks      ,Great app!!!! I lost some weight with this but i ended up regainingit all back when i uninstalled it      ,Easy etc.  Wish they hadn't gone with prime paid features though.      ,Samsung Gear Will Lose It ever be able to sync with the Samsung Gear? That's is the activity tracker I use. And it would be great if I could use 1 app.      ,Plz i want the full apps make it free i mean the options of pro the fre version is just a joke plz i give u 5star to improve it just a little bit like pro thx alot      ,Great Best app like this out there! Really easy to use and very helpful.      ,Won't let me upgrade I've been trying to upgrade to.premium however all it does is say loading...foreverrr. I sat there 30mins with it saying loading. Closed out restarted same thing.      ,"Love the app,  want to upgrade and it just says ""loading"" forever!      ","love it, this app has helped me tremendously on how to eat in portions.      ","Lost 45lbs so far Information is power and ""Lose It"" gives you power to make weight loss easier. Thousands of items are already in their database waiting for you to pull up and log in(or enter custom foods) Set a weight loss target and Lose it will give you a daily calorie budget to meet that goal. Enter your calories burned off by exercise and get credit to eat more (or not and lose faster). Buy the premium upgrade and link your favored exercise tracking device and ""Lose It"" will automatically update your calories burned.      ","New update Not a fan of the new update. I've been using the app for 4 years now and found it easily accessible . You could pull it out and quickly log your meal in before anybody saw you. (I didn't like my friends knowing that I worried about my weight). Since the update, the app tends to lag and it takes longer to log in. I love the app and hope they address the issue.      ","Too big widthwise for device, no way to add what I'm eating to log.      ","Good Stuff Super easy to navigate with a huge database of foods to choose from. Also, whoever types the script for ""What's New"" in the Play Store is absolutely hilarious.      ","Awesome app! As a working mother, i have no time for workouts.. coz too busy with juggling with kids, housework and my job. So this app helps me to be able to exercise even if its 5mins.. i just switch on what i felt like doing like cardio.. and wala.. everything complete in 5 mins. Totally recommended for busy people. :)      ",Frozen It's constantly freezing the videos either won't play or won't show while playing.  I was really looking forward to using this app but I'll have to remove it since it does not work      ,"GREAT WORKOUTS. REALLY WORKS! I LOVE THIS APP! I supplement Sworkit with jogging, walking and gym. I wake up and turn on my app. I really sweat and my muscles ache next day. I also learned new exercises. I REALLY REALLY recommend this app!      ","The burn means it's working I have been working out on my own for some months, but this app is a nice way to break up my routine and give it some variation. I like that I can focus on different things and it helps me specifically work towards my goals.      ","So many bugs 1 month ago, the app opened so much faster as compared to now. The current version is TERRIBLY SLOW, and it's just this app. In addition, why is it that the iOS version has the 100% music volume option but Google Play version doesn't????? This is WAY TOO MUCH      ","Love I love the app, and I use it quite a bit. This app helps you be in shape, while being motivated. The only thing I'd change is have a few workouts for free, and then the rest cost money, because the pre-made ones that are longer, tell them I like to do but some of them I wouldn't so I'd like a few of them to be free.      ","Great workout Able to customize your workout. Very short intervals so the time goes by fast. Easy to follow along to while, I workout while I watch my TV shows. Very easy to use, no annoying ads.        ",I wish i could rate 5 stars I love this app except when I am in the middle of a workout the screen will go black so I cannot see how to do the next exercise. If that issue gets resolved I would love to come back and redo my rating.      ,"It freezes I used it for the first time which worked perfectly fine, but then the second time I tried to use it. It won't just play the workout. Please fix this issue. Thanks.      ",Nice customabilty and its easy to use the quick pace really makes me feel like im getting a good workout even in a short amount of time      ,"Convenient I can do a quick workout anytime of the day or a long workout when I'm at home. Best thing is it does not require any equipment. If you are looking to get bulky then this is not for you, but to stay lean and fit, then it's the way to go.      ",Helpful app The app is very good.  I like it because it uses a variety of exercises instead of just boring you with limited exercises.  It really does make you sweat      ,"I love this While I'm watching TV I can get a work out in to feel a little less guilty about watching tv. It's great that I have to pay no attention to my ohone, just listen to the voice. Perfect for everyone!      ","Fix your pricing model! You must be kidding me! $5 a month for this? I had the upgraded version on iOS and now I moved to Android, so I have to pay monthy? All I want is a decent workout without annoying voice to ask me to upgrade everytime. This is useless.      ",Absolutely love it I love it it lets me know when I should work out again every day and I hated working out before this app but truly I'm in love with what my body is becoming my arms are getting stronger I'm losing weight like I wanted to and I'm getting fit personally if you're looking for an app get this one you won't regret it      ,One of the best Amazing app so many work out for different things differently one of the best      ,Just one problem. Otherwise best app. In India we can't download Spotify. It'd be a bless if you let us play our own playlist.       ,Very good app Just a bit laggy on my xperia z3 and power hog too. customer service is top notch even for free user.      ,"The best I have never wrote a feedback on any application, but I couldn't help myself. This is the best ever; very easy to use, helps fit in a 5-minute workout, very encouraging and entertaining. I love it. If only you could add an option that enables participants to work on any specific body part they want. Thank you for such an amazing application.      ",Love this app This is so helpful when I don't have time to go to the gym or just prefer to stay home. There are so many options and they show you exactly how to do each excersize.      ,"Works well and is fun I am lazy, but this makes it fun to work out as little as 5 minutes at a time if that's all I'm willing to do.      ","It pretty good I would give it a 5 star but is missing some back and bicep excersices like pull-ups, etc,  I've the basic version as I just started using it and think very good and has much of the possible things you can do without a gym or equipment      ","Needs to work in background While I find the workouts are great, this app needs to work with the screen off. It so burns the battery down and heats up the phone, that my sweat literally evaporates when it falls on my phone.      ","Take No excuse for fitness app ! Beginning with the app, definitely a motivation...love the flexibility and simplicity in the design of the exercise regimes...absolute pro!!!      ",Best ever!! Love the way it is set up! Love that it keeps track of my workouts and encourages me.  Love it!!!      ,Repetitive I love the idea of this app but I HATE how redundant it is. I can do a 10 minute workout and get the same exercise 4 times! It needs some more variety. The sample size they pick exercises from is just too small.      ,"Heats my phone Good workout app but heats my phone battery right up, slows my phone right down, which is a problem when it stops Google play music (on random occasions), and then  finishes my workout (as if never started) when I leave the app to restart my music      ",Has stopped functioning Love the app but cannot get past the workout time screen since the cynogen mod marshmallow update for the one plus one. Will change to a 5 star once this is resolved      ,Great motivation! With this app I have no more excuses for not working out. I can do it from anywhere!      ,"Most comprehensive at home workout app With over 200 exercises, dozens of routines to choose from, and being able to custom design your own routines and times, I felt like a kid in a candy store. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it doesn't allow for continuous music play during the workouts.  For example, whenever the app transitions to a new exercise, background music would be paused, which is very frustrating. The upgrades to the app still hasn't addressed this. Otherwise, the app is excellent.      ",30 second intervals only on free version The only interval you get on the free app is 30 second intervals.  This is great for cardio but not for building muscle.      ,Easy to use Clear direction for pilates.   Assumes some level of knowledge on the free  level.  The English  woman's  accent is rather clipped and school marmish...not a massive fan but probably  in the minority.  App ux is intuitive      ,"Sworkit Brilliant app! Just started using it and so far can't fault it, Many thanks!      ",Love it Pretty dope app because it gives you 5 minute workouts which I use in sequence at the gym.      ,Sooo much in love   I've tried out all apps of this type but trust me this is the best one. Others try to charge you for each video or some don't even have videos. This app has no bullshit. Direct workouts. No other means of wasting time.. I am so much in love with this. Highly recommended!  GREAT JOB DEVELOPERS! KEEP UPDATING NEW WORKOUTS        ,"Brilliant for busy people! I'm trying to build lots of productive new habits to improve my life. I wake up every morning at 5am now and exercise with Sworkit, practice Italian then study before heading to work for the day. This app makes such a good start to your day! It's really simple and you don't need any equipment and you can customise how many minutes your session lasts, you don't need to pay for those features.. The least you can do is give it a try :)      ",Keep your body toned... Nice versatile app with good interface!      ,Keeps freezing Didn't have trouble with it for the first few weeks but the past week or so it's been freezing up and I have to end and restart. Might have to just uninstall bc it's pointless if it keeps freezing.      ,Amazing I like it when I only have a few minutes of time and that 5 min workout does the trick!      ,"It keeps in stopping I really liked this app before,  but it keeps on stopping and the videos won't show most of the time....  it's really disappointing!!!          ","Free my App I loved this app (note past tense) and probably got my money's worth out of it.  However, after they accepted my money they now want my personal info or I cannot use the app I paid for????  This running program is free online and I can get by without Active or Kelloggs in my life.  By the way if they had offered a voluntary sign up for people who wanted to meet other runners that would have been great.      ","Get Moving! I'm not one for cardio exercises, especially running, but this app doesn't try to kill you. It has the right ramp up even for non-cardio people.      ","ATTENTION: Paid App WITH ads!!!! This WAS a phenomenal app! But when people pay their hard earned money for an app, there is an expectation that they will not be bombarded with advertising. With the new update, you're advertising unhealthy, overprocessed Special K!!! Their logo annoyingly laced throughout the app's interface. So disappointed! Luckily, I'm on the last day of the last week of the program. I was planning on purchasing your 10k app, but you lost a customer by pulling this BS, so that won't be happening. Good riddance!      ",Paid for it and Used to love it Paid for it and Used to love it as I used to be able to use it without submitting my personal details but NO MORE!!!  So angry as I paid for this app on the assumption that I didn't but now they changed it. Unacceptable in my opinion.  Shame they spoilt such a good thing.  Uninstalling it now.  :-(      ,"Crap Requires network location service to be on,  so completely useless without privacy leaks or  away from area with coverage. Crashes often, won't remember started sessions on restart. Asks for license checks all the time, even in the middle of a run, then exits. Garbage and a waste of time.      ",Really cross Have had an automatic update and now can't access the app without registering all my personal details.  I'm halfway through but can't continue. I PAID for the app. NOT HAPPY.      ,"Works fine, see no reason I should have to have an account It's work and it's easy to use. For no particular reason 3 weeks in it forced me to create an account. Thanks, I want more pointless emails to mark as spam.      ",Bad update. Now requires registration. Can't even access your old data without      ,Can't login!!!! I've used this app for a week it was great.  Now it asks me to login I do and it said you've already allowed facebook to connect it then says logging in.... but never does      ,Getting moving As someone with a desk job that also loves gaming this app has gotten me off the computer chair and moving      ,Forced login Why are you forcing me to create a login? Please make optional or refund.  A login wasn't part of the deal when I bought the app.      ,"New Update Fail! Imagine being at the track and firing this app up, as I've done countless times before and discovering that you're now required to register with some service. Failing to register, or skipping the sign-in is not an option. The latest update has ruined this app! I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for a better, more reliable app.      ","Good App, but bad that advertising is in a payed app Overall the app has been helpful so far, but why am I being advertised Special K cereal in a payed app?! The biggest reason I buy payed apps is so I am not advertised to.      ",Why must I now create an account that I paid for? I have no real desire to provide my personal info. I think it stinks you are holding my previous run data hostage unless I do.      ,Sign in required Cant even run the app now without registration. Very bad!      ,Amazing Makes me want to get out of bed and run!      ,Love it! I feel like I'm getting back to when I used to run all the time!      ,Update has ruined app Was great until it requires me to register. Goodbye to a once great fitness app.      ,Register now required I can't access my info anymore without registering      ,Advertising in a paid app Are you kidding me?      ,Was great... ...Until special K showed up      ,It works! Easy to follow and has me running!  Brilliant!      ,Great App Simple to use and keeps me going. I would buy it again. Able to play Pandora and use app at the same time.      ,Love this app!! Love how this app keeps up with running distance and pace and walking distance and pace.  Great app!!!!!      ,Very easy to use and log accomplishments. Fun and gradual workouts.      ,Made a man Love it      ,Great      ,Love It      ,Amazing      ,Awesome It is  a great  motivator.      ,"Why do you need my info I never needed an account before today, now you force me to sign up when I've already paid for this app? I'll be deleting it as soon as my workout programme is complete.      ","Previous versions had big GPS issues Current works great with one minor exception. Tracking stops once prescribed workout finishes, but no credit if you do a little extra (say, distance to home). Still, a great app.      ","GPS not tracking I like the pace of the app, but the GPS doesn't track right and it's a little discouraging because I can't see my improvement in distance.      ",Milage tracking wrong. Every day the app says I've only gone a distance of .23 miles and the course on the map is only half right. My fitbit confirms I've gone over 2 miles every time. Now the totals will be wrong in the app when I've completed the whole training. I have checked to make sure my location and GPS are on every time. Other than that I love the voice cues and the way the workouts are broken up.      ,Idea Please give us the option to make custom workouts - i would like sometimes to train to a certain rythm with this app but I have to keep skipping or going back between jogging and walking.      ,"I'm way less couch potato! Just the place and encouragement I needed.  I hate running, but want to try to love it!  This app just might get me there.  So far, so good.      ",Love it This is a great app. I've had it for almost half a year and I haven't had any problems with it. I like the personalized trainers. My favorite is the zombie :-)      ,"You can do this! Not a runner; strongly dislike it. But I play roller derby and it's good for endurance. This moves slow and is doable even if you haven't done anything active in ages.  If you get overwhelmed, you can repeat earlier weeks. It's pretty awesome.      ",I have just started running at the age 68 working toward my first 5k and this app is making the training so easy. I love it.      ,"Really good for those who hate running I'm not going to lie, I despise running. But I'm trying to get in shape and start running more and this app has been fantastic! I love that it tells you when you're halfway through so if you need to you can turn around. All in all I've had no problems with it and it helps get my butt moving      ","If I can't play it on background, what's the point?                                                                                                           Edit: I take it back. These past few months, this app has saved my sleep and my studying countless times. Also, my initial review was uncivil (I could have said ""I consider background play a basic feature"" or something) so, sorry about that and thanks for responding with civility. I'm impressed :p      ","Lots of sounds to choose from Great free sound machine. I use the fan sound every night to help get to sleep. With two little kids and a baby monitor that randomly crackles, this ap helps me minimize the false alarm disturbances and wake-up through the night. Highly reccomend this sound ap.      ","Great, just... This app is great and does wonders to help me sleep, but I wish that some of the noises were not as repetitive because sometimes it's a distraction. Ex. The train ride has a click that plays at the end and makes it clear it's on repeat      ","Can't sleep without it I love this app. It helps me sleep no matter where I am...in a car, at a friend's house, traveling. ..the same sounds soothe me to sleep anywhere. My 6 year old daughter loves it too.      ","My Sanity! This app is literally my sanity... I especially love creating my own mixes, and it is the only thing I have found that combats my snoring partner. Also great sleep timer and alarm features. 10 out of 10!!      ","Can't leave the app The noises are great but the fact that I can't leave the app without it pausing defeats the purpose for me. I use white noise to limit distractions and increase my productivity. I can't do that if I'm not able to use my phone for anything besides the white noise. There's not reason for this, today's smart phones are fully capable of multi tasking. I'll find a different app.      ","Excellent I use this for white noise on a regular basis but there is a large selection of background noises to pick from. All of them have good quality sound. I've never had any faults associated with this app, runs like a champ.      ","Love it! Slept with fan for over 20yrs and one night it died friend told me about app and I never thought I'd be so happy to not have my fan(white noise) I have Amazon jungle and ocean waves together its soooooooooo amazing how awesome it is to listen to even if I'm not going to sleep! I also love the different colors for the clock, love the purple one! Thank you for helping me to relax and sleep like a baby!      ","Great for napping in the car I am a big believer in not driving while I'm drowsy. Because I commute about 25 minutes to work, I often consider napping before I go home. It helps me to have the background noise when there's a lot of traffic. It works great. ***Update: I also use it when flying to drown out talking and flight noise. A big advantage is that you can use it on airplane mode, so you don't use any data.      ","What? Hair dryer? Clothes dryer?? Who finds those noises ""relaxing""! Lol... Most of the other sounds are cool though.      ","Perfect for its purpose This does exactly what I need it to do and nothing too much or too little. It comes with pre made mixes so you can get started right away before figuring out all out. Only takes a little time playing with it to get more used to adjusting and mixing the sounds. I love the options and how much you can change them. Great for meditation, teaching (when you need background noise for kids to work), sleeping, or other noise breaks. I use it every night and often in my classroom. Solid product.      ",Sleep with it every night I am a very light sleeper and this app drowns out irritating noises and helps me get a peaceful night's rest. Love it!!! Been using it for more than 2 years.      ,"Versatile I originally downloaded this app for the white noise, but I discovered how much I like the other sounds, too. The night clock feature is also a huge plus, as my wife does not like a bright alarm clock. It would be nice if the loops were a little bit longer. My favorite noise is ""boar swaying in water"", but it repeats about every 10 seconds. On the whole, it's good, but there is room for improvement.      ","Fab Why haven't I found this b4 now....soooo relaxing. Has so helped with my angry, annoying, debilitating tinnitus....thank you        ","Love it I've used this on 4 upgraded phones and it's still my go-to! I love the different options, but my favorite is brown noise.      ","Great Basically a nice, functional app that does what it says on the box. It really helps (for me) when there's distant intermittent noise at night. Putting on a sound loop that's regular and louder than the background masks it well. Good core sounds for users of the free app, interesting bells and whistles for those who'd like to pay for more.      ","disappointing unhappy with notifications/calls stopping the app even with my ""do not disturb"" on the phone and ""prevent interruptions"" on the app. I also used to have an app that could play in the background while I used our apps but this one just stops. if the old app didn't mess up their sound bytes I would have never kept this one... frustrated but will have to make do until I find something better.      ","Great sound quality I can't believe it does all this for free! Try ""Create  Mix"", you'll get just the sound you need. It even has a section to change pitch and volume of each sound separately in your mix. Great for sleeping in loud areas, or just to get to sleep. Has timers for sound to go on and/or off. Can play much  longer than 8 hours.      ","HTC One M8 Absolutely love this app! I use my phone as my morning alarm, so it's nice to be able to use this as background noise while I sleep, and also set the alarm within the app to wake me up! Also, it's nice to be able to turn off ALL notifications/distractions if I want to, so napping mid-day is more convenient...      ","A good 'go to' for sleep Really like that I can combine sounds (make a mix).  Definitely helps with deep sleep.  Occasionally cuts out for a quick moment, which can be interruptive; but overall it really is a great app!      ","Helps me sleep! I won't fall asleep with any repetitive noise like a clock ticking. White noise machines & some apps had very short recordings and I could hear the loop. This app allows me to mix my own sounds, which masks the loop. I also love the timer feature which automatically shuts it off after a certain length of time, and the ability to fade out. I've used it everywhere. Love that my white noise is now mobile. App does ""hiccup"" (sound stops & starts again) especially when other apps update.      ","Really helps I would have to have a fan on every night, even in the winter and my wife would always complain about it being too cold. This not only helps but gives options to what we can hear.      ",I love this app. I can't sleep without it. A wide variety of sounds as well as timers make this app very helpful when it comes to falling asleep. And the fact that it plays when the screen is off is great for battery consumption. (It also helps drown out my husband's snoring!)      ,The only app I use every single night This app puts me to sleep faster and sounder than anything ever. No longer kept awake by my own annoying inner monologs.  So happy I found this app.   Now I can sleep.      ,"Awesome app I use a fan at home, but when that is not convenient,  this app is perfect.  My favorite sounds are white noise, fan and extreme rain.      ",Vastly improved my life FOR FREE I used to have trouble sleeping because any noise would wake me up.  Thanks to this app I always get great sleeps thus my life has vastly improved.  This app changed my life for the better.  Thank you so much for creating it.      ,"My Sanity I especially love the ability to create mixes to block out various noises. And the ability to record your own, download others from the web, the massive selection and the ease of use. Brilliant. The only thing I wish is that I could multitask on my phone with this app remaining open. It closes if you try to do anything else. Still give it 5 stars and highly recommend.      ",Relaxing Love this app! There's so many different sounds even without the add on's. The timer is great. Very easy to use and with so many different sounds it's easy to find one you think is relaxing.      ,"Wonderful App Easy to use, great choices of sounds with the ability to mix and change everything to your liking FOR FREE. Love it!      ","Use it every night! I love the customizable options. I love recording custom sounds and mixing them with other sounds. Another use idea: my wife and I are used to falling asleep to the sound of a particular fan. In the middle of winter, we don't want a fan blowing, so we play our looped recording in this app. Disclaimer: if you have a bad phone speaker you may not have good  results. My phone has a ln above average speaker so I've really enjoyed the experience.      ",Noise noise everywhere Happy with it wish it came preloaded with a simple fan but the air conditioner noise works fine      ,"Great for Sleep Relaxing and beautiful. So easy to find the perfect sound that I want, and there is even an alarm I can use that shuts off the sound and has a pleasant alarm sound. No more morning stress attacks!      ",Life saver Yesterday I had school and couldn't fall asleep turned on this and I fell asleep very soon      ,Perfect!! Perfect for my week vacation at the coast.  Much easier to use on my mobile instead of packing my machine.  This is the second year I have used this app and I love the brown noise!!  5 Star App!!!      ,I can't sleep without this app. I downloaded it when my kid was a baby but now I'm the one who can't sleep without it. I've been using it for nearly 5 years and never had a problem.      ,Drowns out snoring! I'm a very light sleeper and am easily awoken. This app is a life-saver as it drowns out anything disruptive while I'm getting in my 8 hours of snooze-time....Something about the airplane mixed with crickets.... It works! Highly recommend!      ,White noise Fall asleep with this every night no matter where I am. Originally  downloaded while I was out of town and love the choices of sounds.      ,"Involved The user interface takes some time to learn. It's more involved that I expected, but very customizable.      ",Works Every Time I love the many options and timing controls. I fall asleep well every time I use this app!!      ,Nice mellow and FREE tunes We use it almost every night at bedtime. Nice soothing sounds of many varieties.      ,Gear S2 not supported Love my S2 and need to find a new fitness app as i read on the forums they have no plans to support samsung gear.

Tries to record 2 rides at one.      ,"Ant+ yay Finally listened to your users, goof work guys. Great app, upgraded 2 stars to 5      ",Very helpful Not only does it keep track of my activity it really helped me alot when I crashed my mountain bike. I had total amnesia but with the satellite map and graphs I knew how fast I was going and where I stopped going fast.      ,Lg g2 Great but sometimes it won't share my activity on facebook when i click it      ,Yay for cadence Wahoo Tickr X now tracking cadence in Strava. Not sure if this was Strava or Wahoo. Either way -Woot.      ,"Eh.  I like that you can edit maps, but unfortunately the power button gets pressed occasionally in my pocket which ends up stopping the session. There appears to be nothing in the settings to override this.  It also has a very high emphases on ""following"" and connecting this to your friends to a very annoying level. It's the default screen despite the fact that I will never use that feature. Never have with any fitness app.      ",Excellent Thanks for making Strava work with the standalone GPS in my Sony SW3.  It's nicer to use now. Changed to 5 stars.      ,"Brilliant app I don't use the GPS function these days as I use a GPS watch, so can't comment on the accuracy, but my runs and rides are sync'd perfectly via to website and can be viewed in great detail on the app.      ","Can't open app After update android to 6.0, I cannot open strava anymore!!! So sad.      ",Was great and stable but ...... Now records but I cannot view activities or segments. Just crashes everytime. Cannot believe I paid. Refund?  Just updated and still just dies. How can I get a refund?      ,"Simplicity Great software for whom seek quality and self development in Cycling :-). However, If you add the same features as Desktop version it will be perfect. Thank you      ",Cock eyed photos Uploading photos from my S6 some photos are boss eyed.      ,Awesome App Helps allot to see how you are improving and in which areas you need to concentrate on to improve      ,"Love Strava Works perfect on HTC One, there's a lot of trackers, but according to me STRAVA is the best for cycling.

An amazing app to keep track of routes and calories.      ,Love it Been using Stracathro for a couple of years. Tried map my ride but doesn't looks as good      ,recommend to my whole tri team love the auto pause and the segments feature      ,Jorevs Great app does everything      ,"Easy Encouragement My wife has been using this app for a week now, and it's so fun and simple that I'm downloading it myself now.      ",The new look is awesome! The new looks are really good :-)      ,Good update ! The look of the speed details have improved very well !      ,Wonderful Wonderful apps and easy to use.      ,Awesome It always has been and always will be the best gps activity tracker for cyclists      ,Doesn't work The stupid app completely shortcuts my runs and doesn't calculate accurately      ,Now working again.      ,Fantastic app Nothing negative to say. Excellent      ,Great app.      ,Great app      ,Please...   I lost my fit bit while taking a walk around Portland. 2 hours later i realized it was gone. It must have fallen off when i was taking off my backpack... PLEASE make a feature where you are able to track where your fitbit is. I can't afford to lose an $80 fitbit.      ,"Excellent app, takes long to sync It's an excellent app, but the food section is incredibly underdeveloped. I have to sync it with myfitnesspal to really get my money's worth. Ever since the latest update, it takes an eternity to sync to my Fitbit Blaze!      ","Doesn't track step log or sleep anymore Just got the new update on 3 May and it worked great... For about ONE DAY, SO FURSTRATED now it's doing the exact same thing it was explained here: About a month ago the app stopped logging my sleep and the step log has nowhere near the correct steps logged in it. Also the new hourly step tracker does not work at all!      ",Food nutrients content database This app is worth getting but is limited when it comes food nutrients. It would be great 5 stars if the developers had a section where the food database showed a breakdown of food nutrients such as protein and carbs % like the Noom app does      ,"Blaze Calculates my travel on car or bike as steps walked, and recording of the no.of floors is worse. No INDIAN diet in the app. Not satisfied with the tracking at all.      ","New update removes steps! Ever since updating/syncing my charge HR steps is now gone from my watch, restarting watch or phone does not work nor the app its data. Fitbit hasn't fixed this KNOWN issue in the year-and-a-half I've owned my charge HR. Stats display has never worked on this app. It used to be broken where it just wouldn't do anything when you changed the order, but now if you try to change anything what you changed will disappear from your Fitbit altogether. Didn't know Dumber was a word nor that you could achieve it!      ","My Alta is all set up but I cannot get it on!   Lining up the holes to put together is next to impossible!  Guess my hands are not strong enough to pinch the two together.  Now what?  It has all of the features I appreciate, but what good is it in a pocket???      ","So far it works very well, although I have only had it a few days, so I am still learning what I want and can get it to do!      ","It's the perfect compliment to your fitbit.  You can check your status in real time so you know if you need to step it up.  I especially like the calorie counting feature to make sure I'm staying within my diet, and the water intake feature so you know if you've been drinking enough.  So far, the fitbit and the app are really helping me progress toward my weight loss goal.      ",Great motivation I never liked the thought of counting calories but when I got my Blaze watch and used the app I lost 6 pounds the first week.!!      ,"It is convenient except that it won't work with the treadmill to show the hear rate and you cannot wear when you swim which is an important part of my fitness routine,.    These are the reasons I rate it as ok. Hope Fitbit will improve and offer existing users free or lowered fee upgrade.      ",Charge hr Works well but only thing that's not good is if I got no signal on mobile it will not sync why can't it sync to mobile now and when phone gets signal it then updates Web site ! I'm out racing and want to see my heart rate after each race if no signal can't do it      ,"Great monitor of everything! I bought this to monitor my activity and food. So far (since April 12th) I found out that I am more active than I thought I was, but need to be twice as active to get 10,000 steps/day. My biggest ""ah, ha"" was that I don't eat frequently enough, hence my low metabolism. Love these functions plus all the rest.         ","It's good to have on the go and to sync progress. I think the food section, needs to be able to edit more in details (IE. adding decimal points in) I think it also should allow you to scan barcodes and save new ones that it doesn't recognise, to save future scanning and update the database :)   Otherwise, it's good and I really like using it ^^      ","Needs custom heart rate settings Due to various things, I have a higher than normal average pulse, usually around 89-95 during the day when sitting. Consequently Fitbit thinks I'm in fat burn about 16 hours a day, which throws off calorie count, etc. Please fix this!      ","Nice app... But after last update, takes 3x longer to sync Charge HR to Galaxy Note 4 SM-N910U (6.0.1) than previously, if it does sync at all. Sometimes app gives up forcing user to close/re-open app and try again. BT, location and data were on prior to running app. Fitbit notification bar widget was running also. App may need a good massage after its last marathon to rid the kinks for Marshmallow consumption. Mmm marshmallow      ","Good app The app is great, but miss being able to navigate to challenges/friends on the top vs the slide out menu.      ",Failure to sync S7 edge won't connect at all same as others have posted please sort. Still the same after numerous updates I basically got a  100 silent alarm and only reason that works is because I set it up when first had watch. Not impressed      ,I cant see part of the reading when it says over calories or under. I click on it and it is cut off. I also wish it had a heart monitor on it.  Other than that I like the app and fitbit.      ,Location? I've recently enjoyed some of the recent updates but I don't understand why it requires the location to be on in order to sync.      ,Love the app! I love my fitbit blaze and the app! My only issue is the notification part. I have texted as my primary messaging app. But when I have it set up on my fitbit. When I receive a message it doesn't show the actual message. It just says new message now on texted. No content or message appears. So now I've had to go back to the standard message app on my Samsung note 3      ,"Fantastic You need 1 of these.  Challenge yourself, challenge your friends.  I enjoy using all the features.  Wish they had more challenges with people around you      ","Fitbit I love my fitbit charge and this tracker. I can track so many aspects of my fitness and do daily challenges with my friends and talk with them. It has helped motivate me to do more and more fitness training. I wouldn't be without it, and am upgrading it to a blaze next week        ","Update: rubbish app. It won't update my alarm and would keep saying fitbit is down for maintenance. I think generally the app and the level of information provided is okay, however it keeps having difficulties connecting to my tracker, while it's only a few cm away.. Also, the call notification does not work and sometimes the option (that I check every time) gets unchecked.   I would love to have the option to receive other notifications too for example Skype, etc. H      ",WTF I don't usually right reviews.... But I love having this watch and the fact that it's not syncing to this app annoys the hell out of me.... Plz fix it... I bought this watch a week ago....haven't even got to the gym to use it yet..so either I keep record of my own stuff or just let all my steps go to waste... Which is just defeating the purpose of having this app which suppose to keep record for me..... FIX IT PLZZZZ      ,"Good app but a few issues I'm an insomniac so got this for the sleep function as much as the steps. However, while it tells me when I was restless it doesn't tell me the section sleep time. I have to calculate that by working out the time between two restless periods. Shame.      ",I enjoyed it I liked the app but my only concern is that it takes a while to search and find my FITBIT flex. I also wish that I could use that app without needed wifi because I can only see my amount of steps when I'm at home since I'm not allowed to use my phone at school. I wish I had gotten the digital one where I can see my total steps without having to wait until I get home      ,"Good app, works well But could do more with the data it has to work with. It feels like this app has missed opportunities to display meaningful data. Sync could possibly be smarter and quicker but does the job. Feature requests: disable quick view at night, view charts in landscape and pinch / zoom.      ",Good app It's easy to follow and I love the sleep tracking and step counter but I can't have the notifications on as the bluetooth drains my battery like crazy! Still very useful and overall a good app      ,"Conflicted When it works it's great. When it doesn't, it's useless. Longest my Fitbit and App have refused to sync was 5 days. I really hope you guys can fix these persistent issues because the concept is excellent. The execution is also excellent... 40% of the time.      ",Food logging lags a lot sometimes. Food database could be better for Canada. The app sometimes does not update the stats after syncing. Otherwise useful app but definitely needs some work to bring it on par with the Fitbit hardware.      ,"Serious Sync issues - Serious Improvement after recent updates, no more issues reported Need to restart phone before it will sync. &gt; update : syncs when starting app (I don't keep Bluetooth on permanently)      ",Great app Like it all but one thing. You can not set your own calorie count. Would be nice if you could set it based on your diet goals or what your Dr suggest. Not based on what this tells you that you should have daily.      ,Won't sync Have had the Alta for 3 days. No issues until an hour ago - now it won't sync. Pretty frustrating.      ,"Latest update- now problems Since the latest update not all my 10 minute plus continuous walks are counting as active minutes. Very frustrating. It shows I've walked 12 mins, 26 mins and 11 mins but only the 2 shortest walks are showing as active mins. Used to love my fitbit, not anymore.      ","Great app, does everything you would expect. I have the fitbit blaze and an android phone and have no problems.  The only criticism I have is that sometimes syncing does take time to complete which runs down my battery life and I have had the app freeze and had to stop the app and re start to get it to sync. But so far great app      ","Great except for alarms I like the app, have not had any problems with it. Syncs well without me having to think about it much.  The only thing I wish it had is an option to choose the date for the alarms.  Sometimes I go to bed after midnight. If I set the alarm after midnight on Monday night it automatically sets it for the following day (wed am) and won't let me select the day I want (Tuesday).      ","I just purchased my Fitbit, and so far I love it. The app is easy to use and gives helpful information. I have the Surge and it works great, I can connect with my son and daughter on their Fitbits. I don't know what some of the people are complaining about, but you can't please some people no matter what you do..  I would recommend the Fitbit to anyone, well maybe not Hillary, I don't like her.      ",Great App for Fitness! I love the fit bit app. The challenges are fun and motivating. I really like the ability to track my calories and exercise too. I am having an issue syncing my device with the app. I have to click the sync button a few times before my steps update.      ,"Needs more challenges Developers, can you maybe add some challenges that revolve around calories burned or active minutes? Not just steps....... People can cheat steps, much harder to do with active minutes.      ","Detects incorrectly The app detects riding on a bus as riding a bicycle. Even when I am sitting here interacting with the app itself trying to deactivate the bicycle reading it is gradually increasing. There is no option to disable it as an activity I would do, only to hide it or to remove it from my favorite activities. This really needs to be fixed.      ","LG G5, doesn't sync with LG health anymore Wanted Google fit since it syncs with so many apps I use. I like the health app native to my phone but it doesn't have a widget I can simply glance at to see my numbers vs. daily goals. Yet, most days I see LG updates my steps, Google fit shows I've only been active a minute or two a day. It seemed to work for the first few days after installing, but not since then.      ","Basic bug with MI. Please fix it GFit calculates its own steps and when synced with MI band, it adds the numbers!!It should update rather than adding and showing absurdly high numbers.      ","Location specific I do a lot of walking indoors on a treadmill due to the cold weather and snow outside during the winter months. No matter what setting I put, it only seems to record when I move location...which is not helpful when you're in one position! Otherwise, it seemed pretty accurate.      ","Didn't move it said I took over 30 steps! I hadn't moved at all and it said that I had taken over 30 steps. Not accurate at all. Also, add an auto add activity feature for if you do an activity weekly.      ","Doesn't track steps This used to be pretty accurate in tracking my daily steps, but I don't know since when but I've walked around all day with my phone on me and it says 0 steps!      ",Am i missing something After each run I can see the map which shows the route that I just ran but when going back to the Google fitness homepage why can I not visualise and compare the routes of all of my previous runs? What is going on? Surely that's a key aspect      ,"Why can't google get it right. Literally walked 3000 steps today via android wear, and now it read 290. This app is garbage, take note from Samsung with S-Health      ","It automatically recognizes my activities, so I'll give it two stars for that. But it is absolutely atrocious at estimating distance and path traveled - even with High Accuracy mode enabled. It underestimates cycling distance by over 50%!!! I hope this is fixed soon since My Tracks is being retired. Using Samsung S6 Edge.      ",Not accurate How can you run same route and you get three different distances ranging from 1.8 miles to 2.6 miles?      ,Not as easy as some others say Editing any activities is hard to manage. It seems to have a mind of its own.  It wouldn't let me deleted an activity that the timer went too long on and the Help section was no help at all.      ,Not good It dosent record while biking and map shows only one place. No route is dsplyed. Dist is also not showing it only shows. Time when it started rest just on claims .. Sorry      ,Broke my leg 4 months ago so I really like being able to keep a record of my activity and how its improving. Would give 5 stars if I was able to see my activity in km/hr instead of minutes/km.      ,"The app is awesome.  The scope of improvement is for different activities other than jogging etc.  One could place the camera at a fixed position and take a video of their exercise clearly.  Next step which is indeed clever is: when Google fit's algorithms calculate the number of reps, jumps, skips etc the person has done. Wouldn't it be cool?       ",Not accurate Shows way more steps than what I took.. Im guessing about double.. Wish this worked!      ,"Battery death It kills my smart watch 3 ... 45% to 6% battery in 1 hr... With out it the watch is fine... It also makes my Z3 C warm... Turn it off, all cools down... Please sort it out...      ",Need auto tracking and sleep tracking Should be built in instead of depending on third party app. Fitbit and Misfit both had it for a long time. Hope that feature comes for my higher rating.      ,"Smart Detects running, walking, cycling... Pity that skiing is not yet supported. I'm sure that will come soon.      ",Absolute rubbish I used to use My Tracks to log my walks. Trying to find a replacement since Google decided to deprecate it. This isn't a replacement. It has the functionality but chewed through a fully charged Galaxy S6 battery in just over 4 hours making it utterly useless.      ,"Incorrect detection Even when I am riding my motorcycle or riding on a bus, it is detected as biking. I just want the app to calculate only walking and running.      ",What happened??!?! I used to love this app and everything about it but lately it keeps saying that I'm running when I'm not and I woke up to see it said I ran for 10 hours and it's just super buggy now. I tried reinstalling it but it didn't work. Besides for this the app was pretty awesome but this kinda ruined it for me      ,"Updated Update : seems to be working well again. Just updated today Jan 9th 2016 will test to be sure. I don't know what happened but today I was at 5698 steps and I looked at the app and it now shows 1549 steps. Yesterday I was at 16,000 steps and then it ended at 11,685. This application is clearly broken and needs to be fixed. I'm running the latest Android version on a Nexus 5.  I noticed this issue in the past however on just a couple of occasions. Google needs to address this issue!  Worthless now!      ","So Broken! Insane how broken this app is. Today's summary: 12 min of strength training. I manually logged a 37 min workout at the gym with this app. Where'd it go?  WTF!? This hurts my brain. I edited a 19 ""bike"" activity to ""other"" since I wasn't biking... Poof! GPS, altitude, heart rate.. all gone. No record of it now.      ",Missing basic features make it unusable Can't delete an activity? Seriously? I just entered a 5 mile run and it tells me I burned 91 calories.  Wrong. This might work for people willing to let the app dictate how you track your fitness.      ,Not a suitable replacement for Google my tracks This is supposed to replace mytracks but it lacks functionality and seems to focus only on material design. This is a trend from Google  to get rid of functionality in favor of the supposedly aesthetically pleasing material design      ,"Used to be great I used to love this app, but now it misses things like 4-mile bike rides. It also seems to be erasing activity...I will check that my morning bike commute was counted when I get to work, but by night it will have mysteriously disappeared.      ","I used to be a big fan of the app till the recent update. After the update, my walking is detected as biking and it does not detect steps nor does it calculate any distance. The high accuracy mode sucks! Really inaccurate detection of distance with Location turned ON. The UI gets garbled and the animation goes on spinning incessantly.      ",Neat but inaccurate Keeps saying I cycled but haven't been on my bike and I can't remove the activity to correct my daily activity. So glad Google is spending time on apps like this and killing My Tracks for no good reason....      ,It's a nice idea for an app but forgets data all the time.  Edit: I've had enough. It keeps making up new weights for me that I haven;t entered. It won;t remember the weights I manually add. I can't download teh historical weight data to move to another app. The app is buggy as all hell.      ,"Can't delete entries I really like the simple interface. Gives me plenty of options... EXCEPT to delete entries! Fit automatically picks up my motorcycle and car rides as bicycle riding and I can't remove them, so it's completely worthless for tracking actual activity. I like the auto logging feature, but if I'm unable to remove false entries, it's of no use to me. Please fix that devs and it gets 5 stars hands down!      ","How can Google to make such an impressive app for GPS driving directions, yet fail on a decent app to track walking, etc.? I tried it today, hoping to eliminate other apps since I have this linked to my workout app, but like some others, it had lines jumping all over the map. My walk info from Adidas Train & Run, the only app I've used that tracks accurately, isn't showing up even though it's ""connected."" When I checked, this thing was still ""timing"" my walk, 3 1/2 hours now, long after I'd hit save and quit it. (I don't have or want it set to track every move)      ","Meh-Blegh Won't let me manually add activities and doesn't properly calculate when I do exercise. I hiked 1 hour 30 mins and it claimed I went 28 minutes... Also,  I wish it had the ability to delete activities because it always tells me I'm cycling when I only walk fast, as I am 6'1"" and my strides are long. Not reliable, so I will be on the lookout for a new app that works well!      ","Inaccurate According to this app, I sometimes burn fewer calories than my BMR. The calories burned sometimes jumps up and down while I'm looking at it. Apparently when I walk to work I get tired and teleport the rest of the way. The app needs some attention.      ",looks great but you need to restart after update .. Great my phone is off but I recently had it fix that by Samsung I downloaded it and ran around the mall I thought I had everything set up and started activity Unfortunately they recorded everything set for the distance between a point and running around the mall so I guess if you have an old phone you need to restart after an update or installation of fit and make sure GPS is already on and it is allowed to use it beforeanyway I got the number of steps and calories just didn't get distance tks G pretty cool      ,Google Fit distances are inaccurate and battery usage is high. I switched to Google Fit after using Google My Tracks for several years since Google is dropping My Tracks next month. The milage I am seeing on my activities  (primary walking and golf) are significantly higher than I was seeing with My Tracks on the same phone (Samsung Galaxy 5) and as confirmed by my Garmin GPS golf watch odometer.  I hope Google gets this fixed or extends support for My Tracks.      ,"Can't figure this out No dark theme. It says I've exercised for an hour when I haven't done anything (I did not tell the app I was exercising). Previous runs and bike rides imported from Tracks are poorly laid out, I can't see the info I want. Basically I just want to keep using My Tracks, because I was happy with it, and this is a downgrade      ","Go to help and select ""is fit draining my batt"" The first suggestion is lol..  ...to improve your device s battery life:  Turn your WiFi on      ","Keeps failing to track activity I used to really love this app. I knew it wasn't uber accurate but it was a good base line I which to keep track of activity.  However for the last few days, whilst it still picks up my activity from Map My Run, it's failing to track any other ad hoc activity such as my lunchtime walk ....please sort this out!      ",Not accurate There is a difference between a bike and bicycle ride. Please start differentiating      ,"Meh The step count doesn't match my SHealth app and they use the same built in pedometer.  The step to miles walked conversion is horrible.  Says that 6,500 steps equals 0.5 mile when it should be over 3 miles. 1 step=1 yard typically and 1,760 yards in 1 mile. Very surprised a Google app didn't calculate correctly.      ",Very good.... I love this app very much... Self motivating... And maps are very accurate... All the best team...  Keep your good work going... Thanks and regards...      ,"Not impressed Why do I have to use my Internet to run this properly. The stop buttons are too fiddly and the first time I went for a run, I was running 12 seconds before I realised it hadn't even started. I know u can change this, but what a default.      ",Who is talking to me The app is great except that at some point about 2 miles into my run it started to talk to me. It totally disrupted my zen. Everything else is cool      ,"The talking throws you off guard, but it's useful Just as the title says,  I wasn't expecting the voice feedback and it threw me off guard,  ruined my happy place lol,  but it's useful and the app is great      ","Fix bugs! Most bugs now fixed. Hangs up constantly. Will  not stop when I press stop button, had to force stop in settings. Does not accurately track distance. Update: After uninstalling and reinstalling the app, it now locks up my phone after I start the application, forcing me to do a hard reset in order to regain access to my phone and controls. Used to work fine before the last update, now it is crap!                         04/21/2016 Update: Works much better now and they have reduced the number of pop-up ads that were so annoying.      ","Birthday option is so complicated It starts from 2003 and there is no option for year, for example if someons birthdate is in 1990 so u have press ur touch screen 100 times      ","Worthless piece of garbage If you grant the ridiculous amount o permissions it asks in the vague hope that it might actually track your run, tough luck: after a couple of unconvinced attempts at getting your location, it will stop trying altogether, and spend the rest of your session picking its nose, eating your battery and sending all your personal data god knows where, while proudly touting your 0km run to the world. Incessant nagging to 'go pro' and 'other apps' would be bearable if it did the ONE thing it claimed it did. Rubbish      ",Meh I just want to run. The app just wants me to rate it and share my run ffs      ,"This is pretty refreshing Cool downloadable stories and music. Keeps track of calories burned, distance ran and speed and other aspects of your run. Pretty cool. Looking forward to distance training with this app, it's gonna be fun.      ","Terrible. Which ever ""editor"" picked this app is clearly an idiot or is getting a bonus from the app makers. Its tracking is very off and it charges you to know when you finish a mile. Save your time and use map my fitness or Nike plus running.      ",Life fitness link unreliable Don't know if it is the poor quality of the gym's brand new life fitness treadmills (3 months old & already touchscreen finger tracking failing) but 40% of saved to device runs not seen by runtastic aop      ,"Great App Turned Sour This used to be my exclusive running app, but recently they made it to where you can only have feedback up until 1.5 miles, there are ads all over the place, and it stopped recording the weather along with the post run information. This used to be such a great app, but it looks like they sold out...      ","Not as advertised Looked great from preview here but when I tried to use any of the features they were all for the $9.99/mo or $49.99/yr premium version. Last time I checked, that is not free. Uninstalling. Will find a truly free interval training app.      ",Great app Makes u wana run more whn the app tells you the calorie burnt...best motivator...      ,The app kept running after my run of two miles and posted for over an hour...lol I'll rate tomorrow and see if it happens again. :-P      ,"Inaacurate GPS Signal Fix the GPS issue ,first 1 km always says (gps signal lost) then it works.

One problem with it's when crash it doesn't count the number u run..??      ,Awsone Very nice app. Nice configuration but i have some doubts as the accuracy of this app to show calories burn data.      ,"Great, motivates me to get moving! Brilliant app. Would like to change setting so she tells me if I drop pace every 1/4 or half km. Great for tracking progress.

I am no longer sure about the  time accuracy because of this. Would be good to be able to switch off the voice - I have got coaching off but she still talks to me!      ","Loving it! The easiest app I've found for tracking my exercise routine. Simple, fun, accurate. Totally, amazing!      ",Trying hard I like this at because it doesn't judge you but also gives you motivation to go further I'm a sucker for achievements      ,Useless After I start the app I close all windows and put in my pocket. More than 90% of the time it stops tracking the workout that I'm doing even when doing Simple walking. This app is useless. Don't waste your time until they've made major improvements.      ,"Great app Would give 5 stars, but have a problem when taking pictures during a walk, using the icon on the app page, they don't load when completing my exercise. Other than that, good app      ","Helps Me Reach My Goals I really like this app! It is easy to use and and it's accurate. I've had problems with other apps not being accurate in both the distance I've walked as well as how many calories I've burned during my workout. This app has really helped me keep track of how many miles I'm walking , my pace, how many calories I'm burning and records the routes I take. It makes it very easy for me to reach&surpass my goals. I definitely recommend people try this app, especially those who have had problems with other apps.      ","It's pretty good. I use the free app. Tracks me for walks around my neighbourhood and calculates my speed, distance, elevations and calories burned. For some reason it just keeps calling out a distance of 1.6 kilometres with the detailed info even when walking 3 kilometres or so.  Please fix this annoying bug.  Thanks!      ","Map my walk Extremely easy to use, lots of features also. There no guessing in your distance etc, easy to repeat your course or you can see streets & areas to change it up.      ",Walking to Weigh less This app is easy to use and does exactly what it claims to do. I'm very happy with this app and highly recommend it. It even keeps me motivated along the way as I accomplish goals.      ,Great app Great way to track and train. Helpful for weight loss as it shows calories burned. I like the fact that I can add in workout from treadmills and other fitness equipment.      ,Inconsistent mileage App has been updated twice but still inconsistent. I liked this app until I began getting inconsistent distances  that were the same walks I had walked many times. My carrier is Verizon and I am walking in a populated area. I have done everything the troubleshooting tells me to do. I reported this to map my walk and got an auto response saying they had too many people reporting for them to give me a personal response.      ,"Very effective walk tracking Upgrade nags can be a bit intrusive, usability seems improved, overall very pleased      ","Great for my purposes. Summarises my walks week by week, month by month etc. and is consistent, which makes me think the accuracy is good.  I find these summaries motivate me to keep walking regularly at a good pace.

Absolutely love it. No fuss, does the job.      ","Tracking is on point I thought I needed one of those expensive fitness watches! With this app it synchronizes with the ""my fitness"" app and I just put my son in his jogger stroller and put some ""slacker"" radio on and just go. Being it maps the course I don't have to worry about getting misguided! When finished it logs itself, when synchronized. I highly recommend!      ",To much of a bother App keeps pausing on its own.  Then stall and timing wasn't accurate      ,"Helpful Like the app, but just wish it would sync with fitness pal like it's supposed to...

What used to be logged as 2 miles now gets logged as .8 or 1.2 miles depending on its mood.      ,Great App Loved it the ease of use a great asset      ,Great app! The only complaint I have is that is freezes a lot. I do really like the voice that announces the kms and pace.      ,Amazing app Works offline which is great..keeps up with my distance pretty good to..not so sure if calories are accurate but all in all..I love this app      ,Great app! Would be better if it counted our steps while we walked too :) I'd give it 5/5 if it did!      ,Love it Best app ive seen in years only one ive used. so many different activities built in to 1 app great to capture all your excercises now can you add a geocaching as a part of orienteering as we walk for miles just to find a container in the bush with a log to sign. It's a world wide activitie used by millions and growing daily as a family activities.      ,"Just getting started I love using the GPS tracking. I just have to use the GPS I already have in my phone, but then I have to use my data.      ","I can't compare because I've not used other apps. I have an old android phone and this works well to record biking, walks and gym workouts. I've used this app regularly for several months flawlessly.

I have it hooked up to a couple other apps and it helps give me a complete picture of my progress.      ,"Well done!

I have found that and then some in using this app! It's easy to use! If you're a pro or a beginning runner hands down this is the app for you!  Try it!         ,Great for new runner I found this app excellent. I've had knee problems in the past but have been given the go ahead to take up jogging once I keep the distances low. This app alerts me every mile I run. I aim for 2.5 miles max. I highly recommend this app.      ,"Wrong distance and speed How is it possible that I run more distance in same time and my speed goes down?  Please fix this bug or else my hunt for a good tracking app continues.  And wait,  I am in India but the store prices are in dollars.

I logged back in smoothly but changing fb accounts isn't going so smooth. It will find my account, let me log in and then show the ring of death until I back out of the log in. Please fix this.

You suggest split times in some of the coach section descriptions, but don't offer any way to set up (or alert on) those split times      ","Good but lacking for Samsungs It'd be a 5 star if I could use my own picture when posting my times, like you can on an iPhone. Instead of only being able to see my route.      ",Adds random miles to my runs Was loving the app until today. Ran 4 miles and activity clearly shows this but home page has jumped me an additional 15 miles! Now I feel it's ruined my progress as I cant clearly see my actual milage increasing as it has these random ghost miles included... Update it has just added another 20 miles while sitting at home. My profile is now ruined and I have achievements I didn't earn Uninstalled!!!      ,"Limited functionality for Android S6 I loved this app when I first started using it because it had many functions I was looking for. However, by my 6th run, I was having issues with the mapping. Sometimes it would work ok, other times it could work for part of the run then stop even though total distance kept calculating. I didn't change any settings on my phone. Since I did a software update for my phone, the mapping function isn't working at all. I get a pace graph instead. All settings are correct but not working. Switching to a diff app.      ",AWESOME APP!! Really motivates you .Let's you go at your own pace and let's you set your goal.I am usually not a cardio fan.But now I love it!!      ,Pros: Easy to set up and start running.

Finally I got it put in & I triple checked to make sure it was right bcuz of the mishaps. Now the date was correct for 3 days, then come Saturday it sent me a msg saying I had 2 DAYS left! Wth! Tried to edit, but can't.      ",Its a nice app. Just had 3 runs so far. Apart from other details it would be great if it has a weather feature also. For example it should show the run was done under what weather current weather conditions and what was the location temperature or humidity factor etc      ,"Burning the extra energy Do the push aways, get away from the computer, Dig those running shoes out, and make it happen. You'll thank yourself for the effort.      ",Best running app ever Only issue I have ever is the auto pause doesn't disengage when you start running again. Other than that it's a must-have for any runner.      ,"Motivating! New to the app, getting started running again and I find this app very motivating, and it pauses when you pause so no cheating!!

","Garbage I just completed a 16 mile run, and Nike+ decided to subtract it from my monthly total, and add 4x that distance to my overall total miles. It does the same things when trying to track shoe mileage. This app cant even do basic math (you know, a major part of its job for tracking run mileage). Im fed up with this garbage app.      ","Functional It should include the IOS function to share with a photo for the android devices, only feature missing, other than that it's pretty accurate not to mention stable.

I can see my run activities from garmin correctly in nike+. While Garmin bike activities (correctly) do not appear as activities in Nike+.  A bike activity of 20km in garmim appears in the Nike+ Challenge as distance run! Obviously this should not happen.    I am unable to edit or delete this bike 20km distance in Nike+ challenge.

Time is right but the splits will be wrong. It will say when I finished it was way faster than the actual finish time.  For example did a race the other day 5 miles inn1:27 but the splits said i did 5 miles in 1:18. The overall time was correct and it was right at 5 miles so where did the extra time go???? Frustrating the splits being off since I am trying to see what my miles are and I can't with this not working.      ,"Great app. Love that they moved FB/Twitter share nonsense to appear AFTER the run, and the new ""end run"" button works much better in the rain than the old slider.      ","Motivation I've always liked to run but with this app it pushes me to work even harder, everytime I hear it say ""beginning workout"" my body just gets in gear and takes off. Just got the app recently and would definitely recomend it to anyone who enjoys running or wants to start!!      ","App keeps you motivated Add this app to s health on the Samsung Galaxy phones.   Scroll through the settings, add count down 30 seconds (gives you time to put the phone away), sync your music, change the interval updates to .5 miles, add your sneakers etc.... Those are settings I liked.   I gave it 4 stars because I had to uninstall a few times over the last 8 months (giving the wrong distance even after recalibrating).

Does anyone know where those mystery runs came from because they arnt logged down any where.      ,Nike App Run slow at times can't get to my friends list and freezes a lot. Please fix. Sincerely a Galaxy Note user!      ,SO SWEET!!!! Wasn't impressed for the first couple of years but Nike has done a great job of improving this app over time.  It's awesome now. Thanks Nike!!!      ,"Good App Can't take pictures during my runs like others can, still no option to share on instagram for Android. STILL Wish there was an easier way to search for friends. Putting in someone's full name, not having them come up, and having to scroll through all with the same first name only is tedious. Also wish there was a way to edit the shoes you add. Runs seem to be dropped for no reason right in the middle of a route.  adding mile splits would significantly improve this.      ",#Nike+ gives incorrect data The recent updates to the app sucks. The app gives incorrect distance vs. Speed data. Even more annoying is the #Nike+ plus Twitter support. I gave them so much data to diagnose the error but such a waste of time!      ,Doesn't track well It seems to pay more attention to phone jostling than my actually movement. I don't bounce much as a runner and it keeps telling me I've stopped running when I have not. Map my run treats me much better. Very unhappy with this app but it's just not for me.      ,Loved it! The app is awesome. But one thing I noticed that it shows miles ran faster than the outdoor mode while it's indoor mode. Didn't get it why!      ,"Almost perfect Sadly although i loved this app will have to move on as i purchased a pair of jabra pulse headphones and there is no support for HRM's.  I really loved this app as well as it is perfect in every other way.  Simple to use and helped me get back in shape so it is with a heavy heart that I bid nike running farewell, thanks for the six pack!      ",My MapMyRun Rating Kudos to developers all around. One improvement to make is scrolling the year in the age field. I'm old and it took me a long time to find my birth year.      ,Good for tracking and also for people like me who dont really know the area (its easy to get lost). Not sure the calories are accurate but apart from this a good tool for any runner at any stage.      ,"Running sucks I wouldn't say this app makes exercise any better or easier, but it does help me keep on track and accountable for my goals. Works perfectly.      ",I didn't like it that much because it doesn't get your distance correct. I was running and I looked at my phone and it said 2.6 miles and then 10 minutes later I looked again and it still said 2.6 miles. It's okay I guess for an estimate. Also it got my time wrong too.      ,So useful! I love how I can track how far I've ran or walked and that it shows the rate at which I'm doing any activity. That function helps push me to go faster. Also I like that I can save my activities in a log and look back at my progress.      ,"GPS tracking doesn't work Just done a pretty gruelling couple of circuits of my local park, yet according to MapMyRun I've been slowly revolving in my own house for the past hour. Every other app I have with GPS knows where I am, why doesn't this one? The only reason I downloaded it was to check my route times and distances etc, if it can't do that it's pretty useless to me.      ",Needs Widget for direct one touch access It's too good app but lacks a widget for easy access other than that it's the best in the market      ,Great app to track your workout Just downloaded this last week. No hiccups as of yet. Knock on wood. Tracking accuracy is on point.      ,Helpful Used it lots on Couch to 5k programme.  Useful to have record of what I had done and where I had been. Takes a little while to get used to editing records and frustrating if GPS fails - a straight line appears on map to join places where signal stopped and restarted -  but helpful all the same. And you can join up with friends using it too.      ,What's going on? Have been using this app for several years but in the last few weeks it keeps coming up with an error message when saving my runs. I logged out and back in and uninstalled which worked initially but not anymore. It's incredibly irritating as I can initially see all the details and then it disappears.      ,"Not recording accurately Over the last couple of weeks or so, the app has had me walking over water and through houses. Giving me wrong distance and times. I fix it on the computer, but that doesn't give me the minutes per mile. I am switching over to endomundo. See how that works.      ","I  feel this app sets itself apart from other fitness apps because you can look at other people's routes if you are out of town. I have been on some really awesome runs away from home because of other people using this app. Runs through beautiful, downtown Washington DC across the Potomac at sunrise. Chicago, Orlando, beaches along the East coast and many more places in the west. You can set up routes and compete with other runners' times. It sets you up for motivating challenges that are sponsored by companies that have a special interest in runners.I don't have to be training for an upcoming race to stay motivated to run. At the end of the week it tells me how I did that week. At the end of the month it tells me how I did that month. I have used other fitness apps and this is one I have been using for several years and that I prefer.      ",I love it This app is wonderful for me. It couldn't be any better.      ,Great after start up I could change units of weight during start up and it said unable to process...so just skipped it but could never change my units for height and weight so had to convert and then go back and enter etc..  but so far so good...and awesome that it can link with My Fitness Pal app!!!      ,Great for Runners I love this app. It does a great job of tracking your run. However the best feature imo is its ability to track challenges with friends. The one negative is can be a bit gimmicky but the latest updates have helped that tremendously.      ,Awesome! I love so many things about this. Love tracking my ups and downs. Seeing what I can accomplish and the best part is that I can track my distamce and speed outside no need to be on the treadmill! Plus this app links to my fitness pal!      ,"Love MapMyFitness! This app is great. Very accurate GPS, the challenges are motivating, and I love that it syncs with FitBit and MyFitnessPal. Amazing variety of exercises to choose from, and the timer pausing when I stop moving during a run (dog has to poop!) makes me feel like I get more accurate time for my splits than FitBit gives.      ","Useful I use this quite a bit when I walk or jog. I find that it's easy to use in the continuous mode but can be very frustrating if you use the auto pause feature due to multiple repeated pauses if pace or direction changes. Overall, a handy tool for tracking workouts. No I would use the actual distance and calorie measurements as guidelines rather than exact data.      ","Amazing! I've been using this for years now and I love it! It helps when u have someone in your running bracket to compete with. Example I'm in Texas and my friend is in California and we always compete with distance and time! And it guilt trips me when I don't run that day and it pops up ""your friend ran this much just now"".. Which is a love hate relationship... But motivates me haha. Once again great app plus I've gone years without purchase the vip. Will it help? Yeah! But am I broke? Heck yeah!      ","Like it a lot I've used it just once but I did check out a bunch of apps. So I think this will be a winner. My only wish is that this app have a timer so I can do my splits without using another app. Let me know if I am missing something. Otherwise, it's a winner!      ","Too many stupid features that don't work This app has way too many features that don't work. Gps is inconsistent, the auto pause just stops and doesn't resume AND the coaching feed cuts into your music with a really tiny voice that you can't hear above a mumble which screws up your whole rhythm. You can turn it off in settings but why this is auto set on is beyond me, no one wants their running rythem interrupted. EVER!  Perhaps it works better with a smart watch but that shouldn't be mandatory as it's not marketed specifically for a smart watch.      ","Almost excellent I use most of the features and they work great, with one small but important exception.  The daily intake totals screen is buggy, and has been since I originally downloaded the app on my first phone over 3 years ago.  Currently on Galaxy S6 and these totals rarely display anything at all.  Eager for a fix.      ","Purty durn decent app, for a free app. I do wish I could break it down into 1/4 miles or 1/2 miles. So I could work on some sprints. But alas, I only use free apps.  So... like I said, ""purty durn decent, for free""      ",Forgot my GPS on vacation so I downloaded this app to track my workouts. Excellent alternative for tracking. Kept all my data and allowed me to access it later. Just wish I could import it into my Garmin.      ,"This app is awesome And not just for running; you can document all types of indoor and outdoor exercises that you do. My only complaint- it takes a moment to load when opened, which can be frustrating when I'm trying to take off running      ",Doesn't work 2 laps of around 2km and had it turned on and location on and nothing happened. Says I ran 0.01km? Absolutely embarrassingly useless app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.      ,shorted my run My run was shorted more than three miles when I went from urban run to coastal trail. Luckily I didn't trust first time use and brought my tom tom GPS watch. But it was very useful to make and map my run.      ,"This app is great A youtuber I follow on Twitter said they used this app, and so I decided; Why not try it out myself? I downloaded it and started running. I was amazed at how well this app works. It also tracks where you are and where you've been. This was amazing. And if I get lost for some reason, I can follow my path back to where I started since it tracks my location. I give this app 5 stars because it is simply amazing.      ",I really love the app because I can map out my linger distances before starting them or finding other routes in the area. The only criticism I would give is when the women announces the mileage or directions for it to be louder. It pauses my music to announce it but I can barely hear her. If it's worry on people not liking it too loud have a volume button for her.      ,Map my run is my running partner This app keeps my pace in check.  Most times I tend to go too hard too soon.  Having my running partner tell me I am going to fast is a godsend.      ,"Still a top-notch app Mail from the developers showed it's not necessary to share contact list (I had said I wasn't happy with those permissions). Good page linked from update on why various permissions are requested. As with previous versions, highly accurate, easy to use, lots of good stats. With GPS, it can record & save without needing phone network access. It would be really great to have waypoints/lap start points as a marker on a run/cycle.      ","OK but not great As free apps go,this one is fine.  Am still searching for something that meets my needs a bit more      ",Works great most of the time.  On occasion the GPS doesn't track and I get done with a run to find my distance was zero.  Not sure if that is an app or phone service issue though.      ,"Time management. It was pretty nice how it tells you how far you ran, without checking every minute.      ","Map my run I've used this app for a couple years. It's never frozen or skipped on me.  Seems accurate,      ","PERFECT when I want to keep how many miles I'm putting in running,  or biking this is the app a use. It's also motivation when I see my friends putting in more miles than me!      ",I love it love the live tracking feature.  even though I don't require it.  I think it's amazing!   great app      ,My Workout Mom! Gives me variety of workout types and flexibility of workout integration. The gps facility has improved lately. No missed workouts.      ,"Flawless It's Simple & easy to use, and the ""challenges"" help inspire me to work out! Have had no issues nor bugs. I had to switch phones and signing in kept track of all my work outs seamlessly. I have the free version and haven't purchased anything (not even sure if that's an option) and everything works flawlessly.      ","Only works half the time Works fine sometimes, but frequently (running same route) it tracks time and shows the route but misreports the kilometres.      ",Its awesome. But dont go pro. Really helpful!!!!! Keeps u motivated. Although going pro doesn't add anything new to this app. So stick to the free version. And it keeps crashing every now and then.      ,Great app for tracking activity Great for tracking my parkruns. Helps maintain motivation. I run on an old smartphone so I don't worry too much about rain or mud! Would like it to auto start my music when I start an activity. #LittleStokePark #NoSurrender      ,"Full Featured and Easy to use I can track bicycling, running, indoor workouts, and walks.  Gives inspiring analysis of how I'm doing against my historical workouts.  Update to the UI is nice, and it has a more modern look now      ","Great tool, simple to use Very straightforward and easy to use. Works perfectly. This definitely makes seeing your progress very easy.      ",Sorry could not connect to RunKeeper This is all have been reading for last couple of days. Overall a great app but  these repeated error messages are getting on my nerves.      ,Best running app! They keep getting better and better!      ,"Fantastic app and simple to use I am trying to improve the distance I can run and time I'm doing, so finding this app very helpful in tracking my training      ",Very useful This application provides all the basic information needed to monitor results of workouts.      ,Missing manual lap function. Would be nice to have vibration as choice instead of audio feedback.      ,Love using this for my walks and bicycle rides. It tracks to my fitness pal too. Bonus.      ,Thank you! Couldn't be any better free version! Thanks again :)      ,"It gives wrong data in terms of distance This has been a  problem since last 2 months, you pause an activity walk for say .50 kms , resume activity and these .50 kms will be added in your activity.. Also if you keep the phone in pocket gps doesn't track the activity and distance gets less...      ","So far, so good Only used for 1 run so far ... seems fairly good      ","Reliable, easy to use Had to uninstall and re-install as the latest up-date messed with my GPS. Since re- installed works perfectly.

There are little challenges, and you can share on social media if you'd like. Make sure to let the app run for a minute when you first turn it on so the GPS works properly.      ","Very disappointed How can I run 5.25km,you register 0.34km      ",Got me running!! Probably this is the app I had been waiting that was destined to get my lazy butt running.... Great job guys! Will see if I should buy one of your plans if I don't improve much...      ,Runkeeper IS a keeper! I love this app when I'm running outdoors. It is accurate and easy to use. It also nicely tells you when you've been inactive and encourages you to get back on track.      ,Ottimo Con un buon GPS si sa realmente la propria attivit       ,Great app I use this app every day.      ,Pretty good Swapped from mapmyrun after it stopped syncing some runs. This has been faultless so far. Like the reporting options on the website      ,"Perfect tracking in all departments, so reliable.      ",Awesome running app The best running app by far      ,Great application I love this running application.  I'd like to see more integration with music library to be able to control my running music without having to switch apps mid run.  I'd like to see my pace shown on the map visually to see where my show points are instead of having to guess.  Thanks.      ,Favorite app! Love that it tracks everything!      ,Great app Can't live without it          ,Very useful app Just go for it...      ,"Droid turbo Not always so accurate, somewhat expected      ","Cannot add images I run using Garmin watch.

Recommended for people just starting to exercise.      ",Just Superb Basic warm-up workouts laid out in an excellent user friendly way. Effective workouts and keeps encouraging to push the limits.      ,Great app This app seems to do a very good job. seems working well. and encourage you to do exercise. I think the interface could be improve To make it prettier but in general is a very good app      ,Intense but fun I only just started using this App. I don't know yet whether it's effective but it sure is fun! And I feel great after completing a session.      ,"Great app Very nice app for keeping you fit, one improvement needs is when pausing it is not showing the workout images but simply a pause text      ",Good for lazy fellows Seeing Just 7 mins is attractive. It's very useful app. Get it. Fit it.      ,Awesome Very quick workout in time crunch      ,Levels to be unlocked each time This is a good app for a quick workout. One annoying thing is that each time you disconnect the internet the levels get locked again. It's a cumbersome task to unlock it every time. Hope this will be fixed in an update.      ,Really good but... There are no arm workouts and other workouts for women      ,Good But  need ads everyday to unlock all features      ,Great app Great app. Easy to use & very helpful.

Wish you upgrade and add minutes      ,"Quick all round exercise Sometimes I just don't want to go out and run or cycle, I can do this in the house, it's great, and quick.      ",I've payed yet I still see annoying ads Screw you greedy bastards      ,Awesome I especially love the abs workout      ,An essential app It's so hard to squeeze in a work out otherwise. This app gives you a short but very effective burst of exercise.      ,It's a good app Comfortable to use and perfect for people beginning to workout. I would love it if there is an option for variable exercises on the classic workout.      ,Good but should be free      ,Good It so nice I can become thin and los my weight      ,Awesome workout app I have been using this app for a year or so now. It has benn extremely useful for getting in a quick workout when you are short on time or not near a gym!      ,Great! Requires little space and gets good work out in anywhere      ,The best! My favorite 7 mins workout app so far. Love it!!      ,great i have not stared yet working.. but it seems nice      ,"Seems really good The only thing I don't care for is sometimes when you have to pause due to other events in life you can't pick it up without starting over from the start. In other words when changing applications, it doesn't play well with other apps and sometimes has to restart.      ",Easy to practice Each step really easy to do..      ,No nonsense app      ,Great app! Best trainer I have had in a while :)      ,Very helpful !! Thank-you!!!!      ,L o v e Easy!! Efficient      ,Usefull app      ,"Marathon here I come! In the past year I have dropped 100 lbs using clean eating by calories & macro balance on MyFitnessPal and running and exercise tracking on MapMyFitness. I run my 2nd marathon in a few days and feel great!  Thanks for helping a middle-aged, obese male feel like his twenties again!      ",Tried it The map (gps) portion did not work.  It left off 2/3 of the walk.  We walked about 3 miles and it only log 0.9 miles with a different route.  Not sure what to use it for if your figures are inaccurate.      ,Good for mapping but you have to stop and select each activity type as you go which makes it a bit cumbersome when running then walking on the same route. Going to try this out a bit longer before deciding if I'll switch back to Fit.      ,Awesome Great app! Any way you can update to add P90X3 & Focus T25 or Body Beast?      ,"Underarmour  is lit I've used alot of fitness apps and by far under Armour app is the top go to pick for me it's intuitive and super easy to use and it calls out your milage and pace which is genius since you don't need to stop and manually check I highly recommend this product to anyone who hikes,walks,freeruns,and runners my one and only gripe about this app is that it scares you when it calls out your data other than that it's amazing      ",A very well-rounded app I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 4.  It tracks you very well in the way that it indicates.  The food / nutritional section is not user-friendly. You try to be pacific as possible with food descriptions/vendors and it gives you something that you didn't describe so you try again and sometimes again ... frustrating. I gave up on it. It could have some other tools that you use and don't  have to pay for.   I would hate to buy this app and have other disappointments. But overall the apps not bad.      ,"Just an update from my last review below. Walgreens will no longer link to MapMyFitness. I think the MMF app is great. You can check out your history for over a year and you get weekly, monthly, and annual updates as well as occasional ""fitness flashbacks"" for special achievements, all with the free app. I do think the workout types available have been reduced. Just lately I've been having difficulty with the app pausing and restarting in the middle of a walk. I'm attempting to uninstall and reinstall to see if that helps. Finally, I wish the logout was one easy step from your workout. You have to go back to a menu screen and go all the way to the bottom to find logout. Overall still terrific.  Walgreen's revamped their Balance Rewards for healthy choices and can link with devices and apps, including Map My Fitness that covers everything. I've been using it for over a year and think it's great. They've helped me out when I had problems with the Walgreens sync and I love the weekly feedback. Map just got taken over by Under Armour and I've had problems with the app forgetting my password even after it reset. I just uninstalled.and reinstalled and it was fine but an annoyance.      ","5 stars for a great application! I use Mapmyride but it's the same thing. I had one problem with it, the GPS wouldn't map me correctly but I asked for help and got it from their service people (who did a great job.) DO NOT use any power saving settings on your phone and it will map perfectly. I love that it keeps me informed while I'm working out so I know how many calories, how far etc. I can't say enough good things and I use it for free. I have this connected to Myfitnesspal and my UP3 health band and it all works pretty seamlessly together.      ",Great app Easy to use and very helpful app. I gave 4 stars only because it's lack of my favourite roller-blades skating.      ,Live and breathe by it I've used several over 15 years of being a fitness enthusiast. The connectivity with other apps and services makes this indispensable.      ,"App connection is awful I've been fighting with connecting UP, MapMyFitness, and MyFitnessPal and it's awful. The app can't handle a pop-up that takes it out of focus and retain it's state on resume. So if you have multi-factor authentication enabled for FB, don't expect things to work well for you if that's the claim you like to use as your authentication method. Aside from that, it keeps telling me that my info for the other apps is incorrect. I just kept doing out over and over and eventually one worked. Maybe if I keep at it..      ","Excellent, the only app you'll need for all your workouts This has been a great app. I like it because I do wide range of exercises and sports, and I like it that I can track all of them with one app as well as record my bike routes and running routes via the GPS feature. The auto pause feature makes tracking the actual time moving a breeze. My only request is that they add an option under Activity so one can enter in their own custom options. Sometimes I find it limiting what pre-loaded Activities are available to choose from. Otherwise I'd rate this app 5 stars.      ",Good when it works It worked great when I first downloaded it but the nutrition side of it stopped working me which is annoying. But other than that very good for keeping track and motivated.      ,"OK but I've had some issues The app in itself is good but I've had various issues from the beginning: (1) I couldn't login via Facebook as it offered because it just kept going back to the login screen (2) It has shut down randomly a few times when I've just started working out (3) It doesn't always communicate with MyFitnessPal as to the correct kilojoule/calorie amount burnt e.g. MapMyFitness says I've burnt 200 calories, but in My Fitness Pal it days a significantly lesser amount has been burnt (this could be issue with MFP though)      ","Inconsistent I like the app and use it a lot but if I run the same route, the distance can be (isn't always but can be...) off by a fair amount.      ","Works for me Provides features I need to track distance, pace, and variety of workout formats. It may have ability to give me course directions on the go when I want to run or bike a predetermined route, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet.      ",Excellent Great app easy connection to other apps & fitness trackers easy loading...no complaints as of yet.      ,Great way to track your fitness. Great app to track and share your fitness activity. Good way to challenge and motivate friends to get active.      ,"Inaccurate I walked 4.4 miles and 56 mins and the app said I did 1.2 miles and 25 mins,linked it to Bounts to earn points,obviously they don't want to give out to many      ",My new trainer MapMyFitness is a great way to keep up with what you are doing and help you push yourself harder.      ,No issues with Mapping or Logging of my walk on this occasion (1st time using this app). I'll give it a month and add more comments. But 5 star for now.      ,Used to work well but now GPS stops 5 mins into a run and doest track properly      ,"Mapping My Fitness Great Fitness App which is a good aid for gauging your fitness progression. App has been malfunctioning by not letting me see activity feed or suggested friends, Im uninstalling then reinstalling      ","Simply awesome, This app helps me track my activities like none other I've tried before, connectivity is the key for me,  I love it!   updated version is even better! Using it over a year now and I love it still just as much!      ",GPS no longer working Update: gps is no longer working since I upgraded to an s7. No longer accurately tracks my walks. Very disappointed use to love this app.      ,Will not sync to misfit Claims to work but fails to connect and just sits at loading screen      ,"It works Works nicely , I just wish it wouldn't keep asking for reviews when I have already reviewed it.      ","Perfect for keeping me in line :) A great app with a rewards incentive for keeping to workout plans and challenges. Keeps you in line with times and logs workouts, GPS system is right on the button. The best app I have in my phone 5*****      ","Easy to use Easy to use, my favorite app for tracking hikes and walks. I even use the map on trails as a guide so I don't get lost lol. Great app!      ",Great App Easy to use and very motivating. I love it      ,Gps On a high school track 1600 meters is a mile but the app says 1400 meters is a mile so I dont trust the distance at all but I like the training plan and the pro version is free is you have a anytime fitness membership      ,"This is a great tool to measure and track.   I also use it to get  walking/riding/rucking routes in parts of the world that are new to me.   Syncs pretty well, although calorie burn doesn't translate well.   I have noticed that fitbit will pick up workouts from this app in real time, but fitbit won't take workouts that are logged after the fact.      ",Perfect for me I love this app because it makes it easier to track my fitness goals. I am now able to focus on performing at my best rather than keeping times and trying to figure out my speed.      ,Just started using this app and love it already. No more guessing how I did!      ,Flexible Connectivity Calorie calculations for a vast array of cardiovascular activities and automatic linkage with My Fitness Pal.      ,Great app Have been using this mainly for walking but love it. I like when it tells you how far you have fone and the calories you have used.      ,So far so good Just used it for forst time. Seems pretty accurate      ,Nice App Gave 4 stars because there's always room for improvement!      ,"If dont have it you gots to get it Tracks distance, time, calories burned, avg speed and elevation changes awesome app      ",Accurate and easy to use Have used this app for a long time and think it is excellent.  Love how it syncs with my Jawbone Up 3.      ,"Having some trouble I lost a lot of time and effort because at least one (I'm hoping not more) recipe suddenly went back to only providing only a link to the website where I had originally gotten it.  I had made tons of changes and added notes to the recipe from the various times I had made it, and wanted my husband to be able to make it from my recipe this morning.  But I had to sit down there with him and use the website to try to jog my memory and tell him what to do.  I rely heavily on this app. What has happened?      ","Getting better (7th May) This app is going back in the right direction again. Scaling works at last making it a breeze to do the groceries and more importantly buying only the amount you use which saves you a bundle in unwasted food. Overall aesthetic design is still garish and really could be improved but I recommend this app for anyone who wants to be in control of their larder and fridge; store and create recipies that are scalable (make batches and freeze for a home cooked weekday meal, every day) Share with your family too!      ","Its good, the first one of three that I downloaded today to see what would work. This seems good but again...NO ABILITY TO SCAN A RECIPE! Why is this not a functionality??????????? I don't want to spend time writing up a recipe I may see in a magazine somewhere...seems so dumb that nobody does this.      ",Pretty good It's pretty useful. I just wish there was a nutritional information section but I just put it into the notes section      ,"Very handy Sometimes difficult to adjust ingredients on the mobile version (always seem to end up with too many #'s), but overall useful and easy to use once you work out some of the quirks.      ","Great app. Not crazy about new layout I love the app! I love the additions and upgrades, but not the new appearance. I don't like the theme, or the thick colored frames around each recipe in the list. would love to see larger thumbnails of recipes in list view. The recipe photo is too stretched out. I would enjoy it more if photos were more prominent. It would be cool if extra photos could be added for steps.  I would also love it if after importing a recipe, there was a pop-up that gives an option of going to that recipe to view and edit.      ",Best I've found Had problems logging in . Once I ignored that found it to be a fantastic program. Very adaptable.      ,"Spent half a day looking for the perfect Meal Planner App, and thought I'd struck gold.   Um...no.  It's no better than an Excel spreadsheet since you have to do all the work yourself, AND it's glitchy. Even on the sites it allows imports from, the measurements were ALWAYS off, and I'd have to go in and manually fix all of them before saving.  Also sucks that for the Meal Planner you can only add recipes (that you've created yourself, OR imported), and not any of the items I spent hours stocking my pantry with.  The 'HELP' page leads to nothing, and I could find NO assistance anywhere and had to spend hours just figuring out stuff for myself, so have moved back to my old app.  This app has SO MUCH potential, but unfortunately it's not supported like it should be, help pages don't work, and there's no guidance; you just have to figure it out. Well, instead of spending anymore time on it (I think I put in 12 hours), my ""guidance"" tells me to just use something else.  If this ever works like it's supposed to, I'll be back because the idea behind it is great.      ","Absolutely disappointed with the latest update. The buttons in grocery list are too small.  It takes at least 5 attempts to tap on any of them to work.  I use a 10"" tablet and they're still so small.   Also, I've created several custom categories and they can't be sorted, so they look like they're all over the place.      ",Very helpful! I love that I can share the grocery list w/my husband. Also adding recipes from favorite sites is super easy. It's just what I needed.      ,"Couldn't Register Tried to register by email, Facebook, and Google. Just kept getting vague error messages. It seems like you can't use this app without making an account. Too bad since this app looked like something I could use.      ",Used to love Been.using this app a long time but I hate the new layout. Going back to out of milk app.      ,Wasn't very user friendly to me Very hard to edit or change things.      ,Best one out there When you save a recipe from a website it misses ingredient portions sometimes and doesn't show cooking instructions but you can always go to the actual site.  I love that the screen doesn't dim when you have the recipe open.      ,the last update fixed the help button but still give a black screen on planned meal. I begin to regret buying the pro version      ,Great app I love this app and use it all the time. After the last update it won't calculate a shopping list total anymore? Can this be fixed?      ,"Doesn't always work. Website won't work. I can't log in or reset my password. The app itself doesn't always work either. Sometimes it will freeze for no reason and it's super slow. I love the idea in theory, especially since I paid for it.      ",Nothing to say How do you use it      ,Foodplanner So convenient  when  I  grocery  shop      ,"Good It gets the job done, but it could improve visually.      ",This app is just great!      ,Love it Easy to use and keep track of everythi g I need for healthy meals and gathering that meal.      ,Good app It could be really helpful having different colours for different meal plans in the monthly view      ,"Buggy and slow I add recipes on my desktop and they don't always show up on the app. The grocery list component is bizarre. Does organize in any obvious way (meat, vegetables, etc.) and I end up with things like 'garlic' on the list ten times.

Keep it up 4/2016 Update: i stopped using app for awhile and came back tonit recently. Lots of changes that i cant figure out. Like how to add a weeks worth of meal plan to the grocery list. Can only do 1 day at a time. Hitting the help menu feeezes the android. Moving down to 1 star until i can figure it out      ,Getting there The bugs are getting fixed.  Still tends to not overwrite when syncing between phones.  Some items removed from one phone don't always remove from the other.      ,Inventory don't work as it should When moving crossed off items to inventory Why can i just add 1 quantity. I have to manually add more. You also fail to answer any support questions...      ,This app is great It keeps me on my Diet required by my doctor      ,Glad I got a refund on the pro version Couldn't get the app to open and very disappointed because it looks like something I would really enjoy. Every attempt I made all it would do is freeze      ,I cant stand app that force you to turn the tablet portrait.      ,"I used to really love this app, but it no longer tells me the total cost of my grocery list. That was the main feature I used. Very sad.      ",Pinterest update? I love this app. Just wondering if there could be a way to link my Pins to the weekly recipe planner instead of bringing recipes in from Pinterest. It just seems like double the work.      ,I've used this site for almost 5 years now.  The recipes are awesome.....I found the old style (set up) more user friendly.  The new one has deterred me from using the app as frequently due to difficulty in finding what I am looking for.      ,Mark Knapp It's a great app. But when scrolling the recipes. When leaving a recipe to continue on. It sends you back to the very beginning. Instead of letting you continue on where you left off. Not good. But other than that. A very good app. Lots of great ideas. Cheers      ,Nutritional Info? Why do I have to pay for nutritional info? I can get plenty of other recipe apps for free that have the nutritional info. Installing and also unsubscribing from your emails now.      ,":( Okay I like the idea, but why can't we see the saved recipes offline? What if I want to make something, but there's no internet connection? should I just wait for the connection to come back to make lunch for my family? I hope you can consider this.      ","What's up with all the ""1 serving"" recipes? I guess we're just supposed to ignore the stated serving size. It is annoying even when accurate, but often obviously wrong. Just browsing randomly, I have only come across ""1 serving"" and ""24 serving"" recipes, neither of which are useful to me (if true).  I gave this app a shot because allthecooks recently imploded.      ","The app is a little cumbersome to navigate but still a great app.  Suggestions: 1. the ability to set your homepage like you can on the Web version so you don't have to navigate through 4 pages to get to one of your recipes.  2. Off-line access to recipes in our folders is an absolute must,  especially if we are paying for pro membership.      ","This gets three stars because of a terrible oversight in their UI, I want to see my recipes first.  If I took the time to type it in, I want it prioritized over everything else.  But for some reason, I have to go digging every time.  It's extremely annoying.    The grocery and menu planning are great, once you can finally get to the recipes you want.  I don't even know why they have your favorite recipes when they insist on showing you everything but.    For a paid service this is unacceptable.      ","Redesign Please The app is great in theory but not always in practice. First  a material redesign would be nice. The app as it is now is sort of ugly and feels clunky. The website and the app don't seem to communicate together very well at times. That being said I like the app for meal planning and creating shopping lists. Overall, I feel everything could be executed much better.      ",Additional things You should add high calories to diet and be able to see how much calories in each meal      ,"Too expensive All interesting aspects of this app come at a hefty price. Want to download your own recipe? Cool but it'll cost you a dollar, per recipe...      ","Convenient I use this app often. It is very convenient when I'm out of ideas for dinner. I do wish there was an ""edit"" option for the reviews.      ",This is the best app. You can use it for quick recipe or you can get very in depth with your meal planning. I just hope they don't mess it up with future updates.      ,Frustrated  and furious I can not add to my folder. I went to help site and watched the help video which would have been helpful if it was the same as my app. Tried to get in touch with help desk. Now it does not recognize my password and does not send me an email to reset. All went wrong when i paid for premium! It would be wonderful if it worked!!!! Hope to goodness I can get my money back!!!!!!      ,"Great for all levels of experience!! I absolutely love this app, lately been having an issue with search feature. Error pops up saying error communicating with bigoven and then crashes.  Will give five stars when fixed.      ","Horrible app If all you want to do is drag and drop their recipes or clip from Web and use that as a menu planner and grocery list it will be good,  but if you're looking for something to build you're own recipes or build grocery list not from recipes it is cumbersome and annoying. Interface jumps from flashy recipes mode to droning ""linked to big oven webserver"" mode. Unable to upload pictures for your own recipes from Android phone (you have to go to computer). Stupid,  I have not owned a Windows computer in 10 years! Any cook worth their salt has recipes or modifies the ones they get and they build shopping lists a lot. This app is not for you.  Uninstalling.      ","I depend on this app! I am in love with BigOven! It has changed the way I meal plan, shop, and cook...for the better! It makes cooking at home so much easier for me. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it occasionally is buggy and slow. And that makes it hard when I depend on it so much, and I use it every day.      ","Great service app is laggy requires internet The service is great but the app needs more work.  Biggest complaint is that adding to or viewing the grocery list is sluggish. Also, if you have spotty internet access the app will not work well.  The app doesn't render the list and sync in the background like most To Do lists.  If you have poor connectivity and bring up the app in the grocery store it doesn't work well or sometimes even at all.      ","I LOVE BigOven!!!!!!!!!  It makes cooking so much easier.  I use it multiple times a day.  It's hard to pick my favorite part of it because it makes so many things easier - from choosing a recipe amongst their huge collection or your own private recipes (best search features ever allowing me to use up ingredients, avoid ingredients, etc.) ... to creating a menu plan that keeps me get and stay organized for the week ... to making a grocery list that's easy to use at the store (and easy to change/edit - how often does that need to be done, right?).  It's easy to use, and the customer service has always been phenomenal whenever I've had a question or suggestion.   There are so many little features that you can use if and only when you want to, that make it amazing.      ","Luv it and use it often but I don't have the PRO version and for some reason I used to be able to share recipes and post pictures but can't anymore, why is that? I would luv to upgrade to PRO but $20/mth is way to expensive      ",Love Big Oven Great app. Have enjoyed several recipes. Its so easy to use.      ,"Great app I love being able to set up menus, including my own recipes, and generate a shopping list. There are also many recipes to look up and try out. My one complaint is in moving between devices my shopping cart items often get lost. I haven't found anyone else who has recipes that can be put in a meal planner then added to a shopping list.      ","Big Oven Great app, only reason I won't rate as 5 stars is the app often refers to external source links for recipe directions. It is a bit of a hassle, but the app is still well worth the download!      ","Best cookbook as long as you have the space for it. I can find everything from south-style greens to homemade ice cream to just plain old hamburgers in 4 different cooking styles: grilled, baked, stovetop, and forgot the other. I have An older phone so sadly it doesn't have enough space for it until I get a new one. It's a kind of big app. Also, I don't even use the premium feature as usually I can find the recipe through search. Awesome find.      ",Always something new. This is the only recipe app. I've kept. Whenever I log on to this app there's always fresh new ideas. The editors pick its awesome and there's many different ways of doing the same old food. I'm very pleased with the amount of recipes on here. I also never see the recipes repeated and I love the to try. And the save this button. Thanks for a great app.      ,More.. Love it because it gives lots of different ways you can make almost anything with.. love looking on here for new things to try and things I've never even seen or heard about..      ,"It has it all, even if you don't go pro It's easy to use, it has all I need to organize my week, and that was even before I went pro. It is just great. One small annoying thing though is I have to logoff and back in every time to have my pro no ads version, I wish they fixed that!      ","Love it Love the extensive recipes, and so many different cultural recipes as well. Haven't cooked a single bad recipe yet.      ","Thinking about Subscription I love this app. Recently discovered it, but have used it more than any. Tried several recipes and liked them all. I am disappointed that I can only do certain tasks if I subscribe ( I am a broke student). However, if I continue to enjoy the app...subscribing  is my next step.      ",Nice app.  I found some very good recipes with this.   And the amount of recipes available is second to none. I love the user added photos also.  Only one question.   Is their a way to move recipes around to other folders after you have tried them? Or delete them from your folders if you no longer want them?      ,"Lots of Recipes Plenty of easy to follow recipes with a shopping list generator.  What could be simpler. Would have been 5 stars if dev hadn't taken the app offline the second time I tried to use it, use a backup server while running upgrades!      ",Use it alot I find some really good recipes on this app. I use it quite a bit.      ,"Not letting me access favourite recipes I save recipes to the ""to try"" option but then it doesn't let me view them it states that there is a communication problem to BigOven despite a perfect connection to my internet, a very useful app with this problem being its only downfall      ",Awesome It's a great app very exciting if you love to cook and trying new recipes      ,"Irrelevant searches I really like this app, and it's my Go To place for new recipe ideas and quick menu suggestions. However it can be frustrating at times when you search for menus containing chicken, for example, and the search engine pulls up Mac n Cheese.      ",Doesn't work LG V10 I pay monthly for Pro version.  I just changed for HTC M8 to LG V10.  HTC worked fine.  New phone keeps telling me that I need too buy the membership but will then day I'm already subscribing      ,Excellent recipes I've tried a lot of recipes from this app and they've all been easy and delicious.  I've added other recipe apps and eventually deleted them.  This is the ONLY one I can't live without.  It's great that you can import recipes.  Now I know where all my recipes are rather than having to look at bookmarks or other apps.  I really do love Big Oven!      ,In love with this app Started using this app about  three years ago. I absolutely love it!!!! Such good recipes and so easy to use. :D Amazing!!!      ,"No Longer Predictable Chef Mom Love this app!  Keeps my family hopping with new recipes.  Allows me to search for recipes using the ingredients I have on hand.  Such a great tool! Now the question is...""is this new?""  instead of ""that again?"" Lets me search during my down time even if my cookbooks are miles away!      ",Love it Only suggestion I have is I wish after choosing a recipe to view I didn't have to return to the start of all recipes wish it would go back to the one I chose to view and continue from there.      ,Just One Major Flaw It would be great if you could make the application more social. I would love to see my friend's calendar and pull items from their collections. It doesn't need to be a major overhaul but just the option to share with friends more easily would be great. I know my best friends all have recipes I want to make but I don't know the exact name of each individual recipe. Otherwise great app.      ,"Life saving apps Very useful, creative ideas of low calories recips ,easyto use ,makes diet less stressful and colorful. Love it and recommend it for my family and frends.      ","Absolutely lovely This app has many wonderful features.

Will not pull up recipe's...      ,Great app Just started and I can see how much better it is than most apps      ,Diet Great recipes on this site fast and easy. Waistline friendly.      ,"Great SIMPLE recipes This is my go-to all for new recipes (or old ones that forget) because the dishes often are much easier to put together than you'll find on other recipe sites. Easy to use from my phone, too. We love experimenting with new dishes and tastes, this is a great place to start. Just because they are simpler doesn't mean they aren't delicious many more times than not.      ",Garbage After 5 minutes (all the time you gave me before you asked me to rate) it frustrating. I can't get the recipes over into the Spark diet app. Useless if that doesn't work.      ,Second time around It worked really well before I'm looking forward to getting started again I let stress take over my organizational skills      ,Has everything I need.  It is easy to keep a log of food and exercise and with coaching tips and blogs it has helped me on the road to healthy living.      ,"Wish It Was Streamlined It would be great to have one app that gives me a log, lets me add recipes and gives me produce information. All three SparkPeople apps are fantastic, but it would be nice to not have to have 3 apps on the phone.      ","The Best of Its Kind I joined up because I wanted to learn how to eat healthy. It is nice to see that I have lost more weight than I anticipated. The site provides motivation, accountability, wonderful articles, videos and a great & encouraging  support system. Obviously I highly recommend.      ",Home recipes Where else would you find such a great collection. I use it all the time!      ,I've had the app before and loved it! I was very happy to find it again! Looks like it's been updated and I can't wait to browse the app.       ,I love referencing this app.   Recipes are great and yummy.  Helps keep me on top of helpful  nutrition.      ,Great recipes if you don't buy them you will lose weight      ,"Newbie Just began searching,  looks great so far      ",I like the app because it's helping me get my weight in check while teaching me what and how much I can eat to achieve my weight goals!      ,"Thought it was working, but.... It kept glitching. I'd enter a recipe and try to go to next and it'd ask for something not in evidence. So I'd hit the back button to try to enter an "" introduction"", no such thing, then go forward and all my work gone. Too frustrating.      ","So healthy and delicious!

The people on this app are so inspiring and real. The people who made the app are right there with you in your journey and taking photos is so easy.

Just one suggestion... Prior to the most recent update, there was an option to search by keyword or hashtags for certain food or meal. That's either disappeared or become hidden. Now when I search all I seem to find are recipes or links to other sites. Helpful sometimes but not really what is useful to me. Please bring that back! Then it would be a 5 star app for sure!

I can post for a few days with no troubles, but then something happens and I can no longer take pictures.  It also bugs my camera for every other app I have that uses the camera.  I have uninstalled the app and restarted my phone too many times to count.  If this can be fixed, I would happily change my rating to 5 stars, because when it works, the app is great!      ","Very good. I would buy Pro immediately if it was a once off payment. But I dislike the subscription method. So I tried Cookbook Recipes: Recette. That does everything this does, but with a one-off payment. Much better!      ",Fantastic Recipe Saving App So easy to use and they have constantly improved the app's ability to import from nearly every website. Really impressed and totally worth the annual cost.

Sync between devices is very useful.      ","Absolutely love this app! Sucks about yearly subscription.. But the app is amazing. I highly recommend the premium version. I purchased it and I use the app pretty much EVERYDAY! I was desperate to stop cooking the same things. And no matter how many pages I bookmarked or screamshot I never actually ended up cooking them. With this app, I do cook them. They are all in one spot. Ya just clip. Add to your make list. Add to your shopping list only what you need to buy. LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!

The url clipping is the best!!      ","Great app, but needs printing. This app has very few options for sharing recipes and zero options for printing. Other than that the app is great for clipping and storing recipes. Adding the option to print from the app to a wifi capable printer would make this a 5 star app for me.      ",Great tool to organize recipes I was one of those people who cut recipes out of magazines and printed from websites.  I ended up with a disorganized stack of papers.  ChefTap is easy to use!      ,"Best recipe book I was very impressed with the apps ability to gather an accurate recipe from any site you offer.

As a result, this app is my own personal cookbook and go to everyday cooking      ",This is the best recipe app by far!!!!      ,Best app for recipe collectors Love the way I can organize and sort my recipes! And the shopping list function is totally awesome!      ,Easy to use      ,Excellent App The very best      ,"I really love this App, especially with the new grocery list update! I was wondering though, is there a way to maybe save cooking related articles? For Example, If I find this article about how to make a perfect steak, or if there's a site in particular that has great recipes, is there a way to save it in the app? Kinda like a cooking article section or something like that. I don't know if that's something you would consider adding in the future.      ","Catalogue all your online recipes This is a great app for saving recipes off of the internet and cataloging them. It does really well at recording just the relevant parts of the webpage and assembling them as a recipe with the ingredients, method etc. The only addition to the app I wish to see is the ability to take photos of recipes and provide optical character recognition to record the text from magazines and books. Other than that this is an amazing app the user interface is nice.      ",Great for any cook! So easy to use.   I use this app many times week.  It is not only convenient for finding and saving recipes but also for stopping at the grocer's for a few extra ingredients you may need on your way home from work.      ,"Good app, but Pro version too expensive A good recipe app that I would recommend. However, you're limited to 100 recipes unless you get the Pro version, which also provides other features. The app's providers want $15.99 per year for Pro, which I consider very excessive. Bring down the cost and they'll get the fifth rate star.      ",Great stuff. But expensive subscription I would prefer to spend a 1 time fee of maybe 30 bucks to keep my recipes forever rather than have to keep paying indefinitely to keep them accessible. Only downer.  Aside the thing Its Great. Error rate on pulling recipes is so low and they even grab the picture. Love it. Will be a sad day when i reach the 100 recipe mark.      ,"Extremely Useful I love this app. It stores and organizes  recipes easily from any website or blog. I use it frequently. ***When I needed to email Support with a question, they were wonderfully helpful!      ","I love this app! Works great on my Galaxy Tab S & on my Droid Turbo. This is the best recipe app around! I have the pro paid version which is totally worth the price for the quality of this app & ability to save unlimited recipes. I've got thousands of saved recipes on sites all over the net, but I've made sure to save them on this app too because it's easier to access them. Recipes can be organized however you like by category, & put into a ""make"" category temporarily which is super useful. Being able to clip from any site on the net is great, now I've got a place with all my recipes organized just as I like. The new shopping list component is useful too as the app syncs easily from my tablet to my phone. I've never written a long review of an app before, but I just love Cheftap. Hope they stay in business!      ","Best with 1 suggestion. I've tried a lot of these apps, including the pay apps and this one is by far the best in my opinion.  It's the easiest to move recipes to from Evernote, books,  and websites. I love that you aren't limited to what sites you use because I follow a lot of blogs. The only thing I would like to see (that no other app has either) is the ability to import recipes from pdf cook books.      ","Accurate Clipping with Good Fallbacks Not only does it scrape recipes well, but it makes it very easy to correct details or modify a recipe after the fact. The newer Shop feature is very good, and incredibly convenient      ","Finally!! Shopping list! The best. No other app does this! It's amazing! Worth the price of a subscription, easily.      ","Finally! Love this app due to the simplicity and functionality. I send all of my recipes here, even if I'm in another food/recipe app. I can edit the steps, add comments for next time, add pics, and add the items for a recipe to a shopping list to buy later. Also makes it so much easier to file my recipes. Definitely recommend!      ","Does what it says Good app, would give it 5   if you could import from word      ",Great recipe storing app The directions to grab the first recipe make it easy and once you do that it sets up a sharing link that makes grabbing new recipes just two taps! Editing any part of the recipe is easy and it remembers where it came from so you can find missing parts. I also really like the formatting of the recipes in the app. The fonts are a good size and easy to read and the app makes good use of white space as well.      ,Cheftap recipes Love this app. I add my favorite recipes and have them in one place.      ,Limited choices Chicken thighs had no recipes so i adapted chicken breasts. Corn meal had no recipes do i am seeking another site.      ,"There are some very good recipe, looking forward to trying the ones that interest me.      ","Not the best... Sure, this app has good recipes, that look healthy, but it doesn't update with new ones, you have to scroll through them to see all. I can't search for certain foods, and I'm not going to spend all day scrolling to see if I can find a different recipe for potatoes. Going to find a new app that I like better.      ",Good idea Search option doesn't work recipes won't show up      ,It is not healthy i looked at some of the sweet recipies and it had brown sugar      ,So many good recipes. Cant wait to try them.      ,Wonderful I think I and my boyfriend will benefit from it!      ,Healthy recipes Have some good ones.      ,So have made a couple receives  and have been good. Would be nice to search and/or not have to start over each time at the beginning.      ,Healthy recipe I would like to know how much calories are in the dish.      ,Kim's New Years eating Absolutely love it      ,Yummy Looks great. Can't wait to start cooking      ,Exclusively online I like the app but it can't be used offline. Why?      ,Nice app BUT Wish it would let you know what the calories are on receipe.      ,ILovethe recipes ilovecookin]ingothpp      ,Food for your heart Best ever      ,It's really for new ideas:)      ,Best recipes app Thsnks      ,Great app if you feel like you lost your inspiration!!!:))      ,Not exactly healthy Lots of canned suggestions and not really fresh.

Use daily.  The recipes have proven worthy.  One issue...the FAVORITES section.  I click on a recipe, but a different ""fav"" pops up.  Eventually, after clicking through my list, I find the one I want!      ","Great app, healthy recipes but disappointed to find it does not have meal planning/menu creation functions like the website. Also doesnt create automatic shopping list, a huge plus for working moms      ",Great app annoying bug I love this app and its recipes but the bug under the favorites section is really annoying. When you click on a recipe another one comes up. Please fix this!!!!      ,Not good...smh I really like the website however this app will not let me read the recipes or see pictures.  It always boots me off. Tried for a week to open and nothing. Back to the Web page for me      ,"Great recipes, but the app has a few bugs Love the recipes, but the favorites list brings up the wrong recipe when a particular one is selected.  Also, the app randomly crashes on my Nexus 7 with Android 4.3.      ","Useful I just installed this app and it looks great.  It's easy to use and the recipes look pretty good from what I've seen so far. I'll have to test a few  to see if they actually taste good but for someone like me who is always trying to think of good and healthy meals to make for my family,  this app could be used a lot!      ",Lovely App I have been using the eating well website since a long time. The recipes are refreshing and tasty.      ,"Favorites bug, opens up different recipes when used. Seems to have been going on a while based on other reviewers.      ",Can't Get enough! !! Love living and eating healthy!      ,Sucks Won't let Andrioad open it      ,"Finally!..... Thank you.  :-) This is exactly what I've been looking for, easy to USSR and great recipes.      ",Great for spur of the moment meal ideas! Love it!      ,Had on iphone Love love love. Quick lunch and dinner recipes      ,Love it      ,Khushii sy      ,"Too unorganized to use Does not properly organize recipes at all. Pork is NOT a vegetarian ingredient, nor is fish! If this problem were fixed, I'd consider using this app.      ",Meh. Heres y. I have been using the website for a few years since eating clean and I would say this app lacks the save recipe function. Would be nice if it could sync with website. Its an okay app but needs more capability like website.      ,Can't Search Everything Annoying that you cannot just search for a recipe but have to select the course first.      ,"Eat well = eat unhealthy Its a good app, but it doesn't exactly promote healthy eating!      ",Healthy in a HURRY? I downloaded this app because of the name: Healthy in a Hurry. Because I wanted an app that had recipes that were healthy and fast. Duh. First recipe I clicked on prep time: over an hour. Wtf? That's not fast at all. Disappointed and uninstalling now.      ,Could not download. I tried to download the app and I received an error stating it would not load to device or sd card.      ,Great for beginners      ,Wooww Fantastice ......      ,Lacking It is very hard to find foods served in restaurants. I always have to use another app to find the foods and value.      ,"Super easy to use. I like that I am becoming aware of the calories I eat. Even if I'm over goal, it teaches you which foods are monopolizing your calorie budget. They have an extensive database of restaurants and their menu items; So, if you eat out, it is easy to find your meal when you aren't able to scan it.      ",Thumbs Up!!! So far I deleted all of my other weight loss apps and find this app the best. Very organized accurate and motivating.      ,"Ad placement on new update I know you guys need to make your money and I've been using your app since WAY back when you guys first came out and have enjoyed this app immensely, but your ad placement is getting out of hand. Placing an ad on the top of the log page is SO annoying and highly distracting. It also seems to re-load at a pretty constant rate which leads me to think it's using my data unnecessarily. Be creative with your ad placement and not look like you only care about us a revenue source.      ","Ads / overpriced subscription I've been a user of this app for a long time. I understand the need to monetize, but it's starting to get a bit out of hand. Premium is too expensive, and now there are ads cluttering up the UI. Not a good move.      ","Great app! It took a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it this is a great app! It is easy to use & a very effective weight loss tool. I'm already down 29 lbs.      ","My favorite health app!  It has been very useful to me and my health goals.  I love that you can make recipes that combines ingredients and divides it into servings, helping out the home-cook!  It has an extensive database, part of which is crowd-sourced.  Crowd-sourcing does have its downfalls (sometimes items are inaccurate), but this app compensates by allowing you to edit food details, for instance, after scanning a barcode.  Sometimes it lacks restaurant items, but you can enter a custom item (such as something you looked up on google) and that is good enough for me.  The custom options really make the app!  Besides those benefits, this is the one app I love updating.  The team actually writes what is being improved in the ""what's new"" section, making it seem like someone actually cares and is working on real problems.  The developers seem to actually listen to complaints and FIX the problems!  Keep up the good work guys!      ","Better than MFP I definitely find the UI and UX better than MFP. Easier to use, more intuitive, better looking, less obtrusive ads and sponsored content. Only thing missing is Garmin connect communication! Definitely bump up to 5 stars with that functionality.      ","Great App Love this app. Downloaded after reading bad reviews about weight watchers. It is easy to use and lots of great features. My favorite is the barcode scanner. It makes it easy to add the calories onto my daily log. I also love that I could link my activity tracker to the app. It adds my calories earned from exercise. So great. Download it, you won't regret it. I am thinking that I might purchase the premium app based on how great the free version is.      ","After 3 attempts to resolve the problem...linking with Google Fit ""breaks"" the app.  You lose the ability to scan or manually search for foods to enter and the app locks up.  The developers are aware of this, but my last email response stated that they hadn't identified the ""glitch"" so they can't estimate when it will be resolved and to keep an eye on updates in the Google Play store.  As a paid subscriber that only paid for the sync ability, I'm not happy.  They extended my membership 2 months as compensation, but that was 2 months ago and the app is still not working.  If I have to use an app that won't sync with Google Fit I might as well go back to MyNetDiary since it has far superior Diabetes tracking and reporting.      ","Good app This app kept me accountable for my 30-lb weight loss, and continues to be the best thing I have done for my health. I like the layout and ease of use, and as a result, I've never lost motivation to log my food everyday.      ",Love it! This app really keeps you on track.. It's super easy to use and when I do follow it.. I Lose weight! I have recommended it to several friends! I think there are a few minor bugs with sending friend invites and I wish you were able to post pictures in the comment field . especially for the challenges. . All in all.... GREAT APP!      ,"Could be better for android Easy to use food tracker, but doesn't sync with samsung gear, so it doesn't recognize my steps.  Food calorie counts with Android seem off in many cases. Worked much better with my IPhone.      ",Excellent program After I found how to work with its unfriendly interface I was amazed how powerful is it. There are complete list of foods and dishes including international. Thank you for this awesome software!!!      ,"Love the interface! I used to track calories with MyFitnessPal, but I found the interface on that app cumbersome and difficult to use. I really like the interface on Lose It!      ","Good app, bad localization for Android. This app is rather intelligent, but fails 3/4 times to let me search up my entries on strong 50 MB WiFi. Please fix.      ",My last diet i used my fitness pal. These are the best 2 apps for diet control and i suppose it would be personal preference between the two.      ,"Good but errors I cannot change So having to uninstall. Confused, it asked for my weight etc at the startup, once on the app it's telling me I weigh 13kg that's TWO stone so I need to eat 3000 calories a day. I entered the correct weight, it won't let me change it or I can't find an option to do so in all of the settings. If that part was cleared up then sure it seems like a great app with the pie charts and calorie search/goals etc      ",Buggy This is extremely buggy.  Search doesn't work.  Can't pull up right foods. Repetitive foods and many have different calorie counts.      ,"Love it! I cannot say enough good things about Lose it. I recommend it (highly) to anyone who wants to safely lose weight at a healthy rate. Even the ""free"" app is pretty darn good if you ask me. Much better than other weight loss/activity tracking apps I have tried. Thanks Lose it!      ","Keep track and lose as much as you want Love this, I've done well with this app. Gonna go strong again!      ","Not quite as user friendly as other aps I've been using Noom for about a year,  and functionality of the two aps are nearly identical. I tried LoseIt as it works with the Microsoft Band 2. However, LoseIt is a far chunkier UI (compared to Noom) and it's food item search is intolerably slow,  both with on line wifi and offline. On the plus side,  it's recipes are better, and it's integration with the Microsoft health service strong.      ",Half done I dont need to lose weight i need to gain it i like the food tracking portion of this app but unfortunately it isnt geared towards my health goals of gaining weight hopefully you guys consider not everyone is over weight some people are on the opposite side of the spectrum      ,"Works for me! But... This app has been useful to me for two years+ in logging food. However...now less user-friendly, more complicated to enter foods and barcode button located too close to other feature. Using Android on phone.      ","Incorrect information Has nice some features. Soon as I downloaded I scanned several items in my kitchen...unfortunately it was incorrect on the calories on several items, and not by a small amount. Being several hundred calories off in a diet app makes it hard to trust.      ","Great! I love that you can use the barcode to log calories....what I would love to tweak, would be logging excersise calories burned, because there is a differnce in your number to what I abctually burn. I would love it if you were able to change the number and allow you to type in notes like cardio trainer app. I went from a 4 star to a 3 star due to me switching from a fitbit to a Garmin Vivofit HR and lose it does not sync with Garmin products, super dissapointing.      ","Great App but it's frustratingly slow at times I switched from Myfitnesspal app to this. I like it overall but when searching the food database, I find it to be way too slow. There should be an option to download the food database to the app and for it to update the cached database automatically. This would speed up searches greatly and I believe fix my issues.      ",Not accurate always Sometimes when I log food it doesn't add it to my daily total and says I have eaten less calories than I have. For example yesterday it only counted my breakfast even though I logged lunch and dinner and snacks      ,Great app!!!! I lost some weight with this but i ended up regainingit all back when i uninstalled it      ,Easy etc.  Wish they hadn't gone with prime paid features though.      ,Samsung Gear Will Lose It ever be able to sync with the Samsung Gear? That's is the activity tracker I use. And it would be great if I could use 1 app.      ,Plz i want the full apps make it free i mean the options of pro the fre version is just a joke plz i give u 5star to improve it just a little bit like pro thx alot      ,Great Best app like this out there! Really easy to use and very helpful.      ,Won't let me upgrade I've been trying to upgrade to.premium however all it does is say loading...foreverrr. I sat there 30mins with it saying loading. Closed out restarted same thing.      ,"Love the app,  want to upgrade and it just says ""loading"" forever!      ","love it, this app has helped me tremendously on how to eat in portions.      ","Lost 45lbs so far Information is power and ""Lose It"" gives you power to make weight loss easier. Thousands of items are already in their database waiting for you to pull up and log in(or enter custom foods) Set a weight loss target and Lose it will give you a daily calorie budget to meet that goal. Enter your calories burned off by exercise and get credit to eat more (or not and lose faster). Buy the premium upgrade and link your favored exercise tracking device and ""Lose It"" will automatically update your calories burned.      ","New update Not a fan of the new update. I've been using the app for 4 years now and found it easily accessible . You could pull it out and quickly log your meal in before anybody saw you. (I didn't like my friends knowing that I worried about my weight). Since the update, the app tends to lag and it takes longer to log in. I love the app and hope they address the issue.      ","Too big widthwise for device, no way to add what I'm eating to log.      ","Good Stuff Super easy to navigate with a huge database of foods to choose from. Also, whoever types the script for ""What's New"" in the Play Store is absolutely hilarious.      ","Loved it until... Loved the app until I realized it does not do the math correctly on portions/servings.  If you only eat 1/2 a serving, it still counts the entire serving for your totals!  I cant sit here and enter every food 10 different times with different serving sizes.  Not worth the effort.      ","Nice app! I like this app ... easy to use and personalize. The only thing I would suggest is that there should be subtotals for each meal ... for protein, carbs and fat.  Each meal should be balanced, not just the whole day.      ","So far it looks great! I just installed this morning and the third time I opened, it asked me to rate. I haven't had enough time to give a useful review. I did start tracking my food today and it was very easy. I'm looking forward to using this app more as well as exploring the site from my desktop. Maybe a few days into using the app would be a better length of time before asking for a review. On the negative side, I haven't found a way to log out. I don't want to constantly be logged into any app.      ","Exactly what I needed I've never given a written review on any of the many many apps I've used over the years, but this one is so perfect I had to say something. Everything I need for daily nutrition tracking.      ",Worthless as an app. Waste of time. Buggy. Useless in most fuctionality. Socializing is impossible as you can't add or even find your friends using the app or on the site . Most of the sites working functions can be found on other apps without the the load of adds and mediocrity. Bottom line I would not recommend spark people to anyone as it is completely unsatisfactory as anything more than a calorie checker with added useless features that do not work.      ,Best app I have ever used This app is very easy to get around. It not only helps me count calories but also let's me watch my salt and fat intake. I have tried other apps with failure. I plan on staying for a while. I am a cardiac patient and nutrition and exercise  has become a big part of my life. Thank you!      ,"I've tried a lot of calorie counting apps and sparkpeople's food directory is by far the best one out there. It's really easy to scan foods, find what you're looking for, and add a food item that's not already there. Very thorough and user friendly even if you've never used this kind of app before! Sparkpoints motivate you        ","Was working great until last update App was working well until the last update.  Now does nothing when you try to log info, for both food and exercise.  Tried Uninstaller,  then reinstall.  Same problems.  Too bad,  this was a great app,  linked with fitbit,  good tips,  etc.      ",I have only just started using it today but it seems pretty good so far... Haven't found anything wrong yet :)      ,It would be good if you could search something and the nutritional fact come from the company instead of having to add. Everyone facts different.      ,Great app I love the fact that you can scan bar code of your favourite food and add to your tracker. All the info is automatically entered.  Brilliant!      ,Spark People Helps in every way. Went from 200 to 173.7 this evening.  I am just beginning to get good at this.      ,"Love hate I love the way it counts everything, but how do I go back and view yesterdays info? Last weeks? Shoot, halfway through the day it looses everything I've put it. Its also upsetting that it has suggested daily values... but suggested off what? Im on a ketogenic diet, why is it saying I should get up to 300 carbs a day? And of course that means fat and protein are off as well.      ","So far I dig it I wish it had a larger excercise database,but overall it's good.      ","Everything I need It's so easy to log everything, food, exercise, weight, and everything else you might want.      ","Great App I love it, the app is easy to use and very intuitive. I love the barcode scan, it helps me avoid having to enter my food manually.      ",Love it Sparkpeople is an excellent community and the app is improving all the time. Easy to use and have never had a problem with it.      ,Incredible motivation tool for losing weight This is the most useful app I have ever found to help me be accountable for what I consume.      ,Its amazing Keeps me motivated. Makes me want to go out and exercise and even eat some new healthy foods!! The community is amazing!      ,Has almost everything But it's a little buggy on my phone. Otherwise I love it .      ,"Good app Calculates daily intake of food and  what's required depending on weight, age, etc      ",Love it This app has really helped me stick to a new eating habit.      ,Total Accountability I  love how you track everything according to your goals.      ,Interesting I think I found motivation.  This app is pretty fun with the points and chat.      ,More choices for exercise and foods than other apps. Easy to use!      ,Good app I'm trying not to be fat. This app helps me be less fat.      ,Excellent I've been a Sparkpeople member for longer than I care to remember and this app makes tracking food and exercise so easy I have no excuse. I'm very happy with the way this works!      ,"Helpful app The app is pretty easy to use, like the chat and blogs.      ",Great app for accountability Using this app alongside the Tracy Anderson dynamic eating plan and metamorphosis program is helping me get awareness of calories and activity. Great and easy way to become more health aware.      ,"Great database and I love the positive vibes it gives. Not the easiest to navigate through, but you will get it eventually. Really nice app      ",Huge Database Love the huge database of food. I can easily search and add foods. The calculator keeps track of my calories for me. Navigation takes just a little while to get used to but otherwise an awesome app. Well worth it!!      ,I love SparkPeople I would totally recommend this to anyone looking motivation for losing weight and getting fit.      ,Great This is a great app to track the amount of calorie intake and the amount burned      ,Easy to navigate and use Great reference tools and tracker for life changes      ,"Takes some figuring out Journaling and recording food and exercise is easy. But creating and figuring out recipes is not. If I make a hot dish for my family and add 1 lbs hamburger, some rice, tomato's, ect...it is not easy to figure out my portion.      ",so far so good.. one day.. I'll update after using it for a month.      ,Really love it just wish there was an option to share my stats and achievements with FB. If there is I havent found it yet.      ,"Great app for dieters Like this app, it's great for dieters. Set up your notifications right away or your phone will blow up from all the meal and exercise reminders.      ","Works Looking for pay app to remove ads. I like the simplicity. Very kewll. Sold.  Now that it is installed, now comes hard part, I know, right?!!      ","It is fantastic, I love being able to type in what I am eating into the tracker righf ad I am eating. I had tried sparkpeople before but this makes it so much easier to use. Thank you for sparking my health!      ","Probably my favorite app of all time. I've listened to most of the meditations, even the ones meant for children, and use them to help me sleep. I've had severe insomnia pretty much my entire life, but these meditations can usually ease me to sleep before the recording is even over! Granted, I've listened so often to some of them that I practically have them memorized now. I hope that there will be some new ones in the future, but even if there aren't, this app is a keeper for sure.      ","Incredibly helpful! This is my go-to when nothing else is helping my anxiety. I use it several times a week and is very helpful in finding my ""happy place"". :)      ","Wow This is one of the best if not the best app in its genre and I love it, but I use it everyday        ","Wow, I'm impressed! This app is really free and really helps. I have been having an unusual amount of anxiety and feeling overwhelmed lately. Then, dealing with my lower back pain is difficult because I am an active person and I can't be as active as I want to. This app helps to remind me to just breathe and every thing will be alright.      ",Love it It's amazing it is free. Great meditations guided by a lovely voice. Thanks a lot.      ,Great for kids We have a child who takes hours to settle down to sleep. Using these audios has cut that time down to 30 min and is often asleep by the end of the audio. Lifesaver and my kids looks forward to it every night.      ,"A five star app Easy to follow videos, effective meditation techniques and well written, informative articles to read.  I am delighted to have found this excellent app - thank you developer.      ","Be Safe...Be Happy...Be At Peace The information in this app is priceless in value. I have a history with CBT & was never any good at achieving results. Then again, I was not aware of the need for continuous trained repetition for successful change. Awesome knowledge and great meditations. The meditations could be longer for experienced mediators though. I find that 10 to 20 minutes is quite short. Love it.      ","Perfect. Actually literally free. Its so nice to find a free app like this. The voice is soothing, the different meditations are wonderful, and there's so many to choose from. It's really and truly the only app like this that I have found that is any good at all. Highly recommended for anyone looking for guided meditation and relaxation!      ","Amazing Best relaxation app I've tried (and I've tried the much acclaimed Andrew Johnson ones). This app has so much in it and its so easy to use. I always find it incredibly easy to sleep after listening to one of the relaxation audios, the guided imagery is really nice. Would recommend (and I do) to anyone who wants to experience a deeper relaxation, beginner or not.      ",Brilliant Peaceful mindful meditative relaxation.      ,So much information at your fingertips The mindfulness audios I have used with my kids and I use the Qui Gong links almost every day.      ,"Love it! I've had this app on my old phone and when I got a new one I forgot all about it. So pleased I found this again, it really helps me switch off and the audios are so so good. I'm even happier with it now that I've realised it has Qigong videos since I've recently started going to classes.      ",Great app! Lots of choices and live streams from web site so it doesn't use up my storage! Gets me to sleep peacefully and great for my daughter! Love love love this app. Havent been able to find another that comes close.  Would love some new  scenarios though!      ,"Useful, healing, soothing I use this app for meditation and sleep relaxation. There are also some fantastic audios for panic and anxiety. Great variety in sensory meditation. Love. This. App.      ","No Achievemint? Love your apps! Helpful, lots of info, easy to follow for self improvement. But why no Achievemint sync for this one?      ","Useful Great variety of audios for relaxation, mindfulness & loving kindness. Supplements my weekly meditation class as i can use it everyday for practice.      ",Excellent Very good app. Many different audios and videos. Soothing\ relaxing.      ,"It's the best Wonderful variety, different techniques. Great for the whole family, including for labor relaxation!      ","Amazing I do this with my dog who is very jumpy at night and at night when I started this she has been a lot less jumpy and I can tell a major difference in her sleeping patterns, it has also helped me sleep at night, me and my dogs both have anxiety so it really helps us both.      ","Awesome I love this app.  Great info on mindfulness,  beautiful guided meditations, lots of great stuff to explore.      ",It's looking dated now but it does not matter. The content is good and that's what matters.      ,Fantastic Use this every single night.  Love the new audios since after awhile I could recite what she was saying! Good thing that means I can tap into the memory and use it at other time      ,Good but... There is no way to prevent the app from continuing to run in the background when you exit or log out. Otherwise good app but deducting 1.5 stars and uninstalling for this reason.      ,Unnecessary for me Just never bothered with it. I already do yoga and HIIT. The audios are the same as another app by this company so it was just redundant. It works fine just like the others but I really don't need it.      ,"Love it Works great with panic attacks,and so much more....      ",Amazing Its free and it really does work. I recommend it. The app helps you meditate easier and faster plus it shows you other ways with step to step instructions. With a soothing voice and nice background music . Love love love it.      ,This site appeals to me. Thank you to the people that have knowledge in and on this site..good for you.      ,First time listened it played to end was helpful. Then played 6 minutes only.  So streamed played 6 minutes it stopped. Downloaded what I wanted now doesn't play at all. Hopeless. Information tells me there's 24 or so minutes but won't play. Downloaded all mindfulness.  Hopeless. Have u got suggestions      ,Best for me I use it to fall asleep paints beautiful  pictures in my mind      ,"I use this every night to fall asleep. I just downloaded the update and I'm excited to listen to the new meditations. My only negative comment is that I don't care much for the woman's voice; to me it is harsh and the cadence of her voice can occasionally be jarring instead of relaxing (however, I've learned to skip those meditations.)      ",The best relaxation app ever I have used this app every day for the past two years.      ,Love this app! My daughter sleeps like a baby! Thank you!      ,A really good app. I've been using it for quite a while.      ,First time using meditation of any kind. So far I have yet to stay awake during the music part of the relaxation phase of this app due to the fact it relaxes me just enough to drift off to sleep. My surgical doctor asked me to try this and I love it!!!!!      ,Helps me relax so that I sleep better at night.      ,Really  nice I like this app very much it is really  helpful  and nicely  made.      ,Great app Help a lot to reduce stress of life      ,Thank you! Thank you for bringing back the children's imagery! My 9 year old will not use any other app!  Love it! Best guided imagery for kids!      ,Simply great I recommend it to everyone. Change the world by changing yourself.      ,"More options I wish it had more options. Different sounds and longer meditation times. I use a different app for meditation music and I normally do two 3 min sessions. But other than that, I enjoy the app. :) good for people like me who's just starting to meditate      ",It was better earlier. The sounds stop after two bells or gongs. The app isn't working well.  The concept is good that u work up for longer minutes. Which I had achieved with my last phone.  Here its become worse.  I wish there were more options of the gongs or bells.  Sometimes its jarred.      ,"Use It Daily I've gotten into the habit of using this before bed each night, it gives my mind something to ponder as I go to sleep. I really love this app.      ","Not helpful Simple tool, concept is fine. However the quotes repeat and are not amazing. The sounds don't work consistently, which annoyingly means the end chine doesn't always work and so you may worry about if time is up.   In the end not a great app.   One nice feature is the alternative day reminder.      ",Simple Simple app that does what it says. I like how it eases you in and gradually increases the amount of time you meditate for. Sad you have to be reminded to take a moment for yourself but this is the world we live in.      ,I use this everyday I like the quotes. It helps me to center myself when I go overboard on a certain part of my life. I changed because of this app      ,"Meditation App I judt started so I think its unfair to rate so soon, but so far its good.      ",A Must Amazing program. It is a must if you are like me and work alot and do not have the ample amount of time to actually sit for extended periods of time. Namaste.      ,"Awesome! I am new to meditation & this is very helpful to me, love the inspirational quotes & the easy step by step progression. Great app!      ","Simple but effective This meditation app is very pleasant. It also reminds you to do it which is very useful. Two minutes is perfect and it is doable, whereas a longer time might put some people off of trying at all. You can always do more than one session however.      ","Wonderful A lovely app. Simple words of wisdom, and a gentle reminder When it's been a couple days. Really has helped me find a sense of calm in my busy life.      ","Meditation made easy! So thankful for this specific meditation app, it gradually helps you build to stronger, deeper practice and is exciting to use. Has become a daily ritual and I love it. Happier, brighter days ahead!      ",Awesome Meditation App Perfect for those so busy to find the time to meditate.  Really easy todo and the timer is really very helpful.  Highly recommend to those who need peace and quiet.      ,"It's okay I like the quotes and the meditation sounds. However my phone does not register the volume on this app, so I always have to remember to turn the sound up before I open the app. Also, I'm starting to wish it could be longer than three minutes!      ","Great app! As a newbie to meditation, I find this is a wonderful way to get started at meditation. The app has great images and simple phrases to help clear the mind. I enjoy the meditation bell, too.      ","Very pleased Have wanted to get back into meditation for a long while and this is making it easy to do so. Only complaint is the bell isn't sounding at the end, but sitting a little longer isn't a bad thing.      ",Nice intro to meditation If your constantly on the go and find it difficult to meditate for long periods of time. This app is for you. with shorter sessions of meditation you can practice in time that works for you and still get the benefits of mindful meditation      ,The wisdom I learned by meditating Our mind n thoughts determines our happiness or unhappiness in life. Patience is a important key in life n loving n letting go is a part of all relationships.      ,Very nice As a parent It is a tough balance between personal happiness and family happiness. Thanks to this wonderful app I can revisit my sits in the zen temple and really feel realizing one self to the maximum. Thank you for this wonderful tool for all of us busy people. Namo Amitabha      ,"Calming This app comes with beautiful words of wisdom to help you focus and calm your mind.  I really like that it has option to turn bell on or off.    Only downside is I wish it was timed at 10 minutes instead of 3 minutes,  for me it just seems a bit short but it's a perfect amount of time for any person with a busy life.  I highly recommend this app to anyone!      ",Good app The sound settings are a little buggy and I also wish you could change the length of meditation instead of having to move up in levels... but other than that it is a great app.      ,"Enjoying ""breaking into"" meditation one step at a time. Update: I got a new phone and lost all my data forcing me back to short meditation sessions. Wish there was a backup.  This is helping my new year resolution and bringing me peace in my life.      ","Good introduction to meditation Good, basic app. Images and words a bit repetitive but it's a start. If 3 minutes isn't enough I just press restart - I don't find that too interruptive.      ",Very cool app Keeps you at 0 stress level during day. Good time for me is morning/onwakeup & evening/beforebed      ,Meditate Great I know meditation is simple and can be difficult too. This app really is helping me get started. I like it a lot.      ,"Anxiety relief As a teenager who adjusts the changes on becoming an adult, I recommend the helpful quotations to ease our uncalm minds      ",Worth it I struggle with bad anxiety and depression. I use this for 3 minutes a day sometimes twice! It really helps to calm the seemingly endless train of thoughts in my head.      ,"Worth it This app is convenient and helps me refocus when I get off track. Even if you don't practice consistently, the mantras are perfect for resetting your thoughts and awareness.      ",Tranquil Great for a moment of peace in all our busy and distracted lives. So much benefit in one little app. I listen to this every day.      ,"Not a fan of the messages The concept & design are nice, but the messages are nearly all stated in negative terms. Pay attention and you'll see... Everything is ""don't"" or ""not"". Today I'm finally installing it because the first words were ""Failure is...""  A truly good meditation should be started in positive terms.      ",Nice meditation Cool app.  Very handy when you feel a little stressed out.      ,Calming Easy to use.   I've gotten a couple of the  same words of wisdom which is disappointing but only a little and I've switched phones so that's part of the reason.      ,Great meditation starter I was skeptical of meditation in general but this app has really introduced a meaningful process into my habits.      ,"It's good! Good app, found the sounds a little harsh but you can turn them off so its fine.      ",New to meditation I am just starting to learn hoe to meditate.  I like how it starts you out slow and adds time as you go.      ,Awesome app I love this app and have recommended it ot lots of people. The only thing it needs is music of something. I just play the ocean on my sound box.      ,AMAZING!!! ACTUALLY LEAVES MY MIND FREE OF UGLY THOUGHTS AFTER! MUST TRY IF U HAVE ANXIETY OR BAD THOUGHTS N WORRIES EVERY SECOND!!!      ,"On the money At first I was like this is boring but about 90 seconds in enlightenment strikes and the words can be applied to your life, 5 stars!      ","Not user-friendly It is simplistic which is why I chose it but it is not interactive. On opening the app there are no instructions on how it will help you, it won't let me change the meditation time from the set 3 minutes and the sound is not consistent. When you do eventually set it all it does is ping a bell. I could do this with my own music myself!      ","Simple & effective Quite powerful, in my experience. I peaced out on a crowded subway car thanks to this app. I might have even given it 5 stars had the creator not asked for that rating.      ",Glad it's still here I have had this app for a long time and went through a few phone changes and just didn't get it back on . Tried a few others and nope ...Nothing like this one !      ,"The best Excellent app. Helps with aches and pains, afternoon tiredness, stress, and yes, hangovers. I do it daily or more. There is always time, do it instead of watching TV. I like laying down best. Also great in the bath. A must have.      ",Wow Ive been so tense lately and its affecting my relationship. Ive just listened to it for the first time and at the end my head was clear. Think I need to do this two or three times a day just untill I feel completely relaxed and clear all my bad thoughts      ,Great! Great when I need to break out of my office chaos for half an hour.                                                This is not for sleeping as he does snap you out of it with counting but that's why it's for relaxation. It gets you to a good place so you can go face the world again. He has an app for sleep and I quite like it. If you're looking for help sleeping that's the one for you. If you're just trying to take a break and then get right back on your feet you will like this.      ,"Phemonenal I thought something scary was gonna happen like a cream but no.... his voice and the music blend so well,this is the therapy everyone needs.I've been having a bad time, all tired and moody (hormones) then I used this. And this is no exaggeration, it has changed my life! I am now more relaxed and controlled and very concentrated!      ",Awesome Narration Narrator has a very soothing gentle Scottish accent. Great app!      ,Awesome His voice is rich and relaxing.  The calm music is gentle in the background.  So far the best app for relaxing.      ,Wow... It works! I suffer from extreme anxiety attacks and  am also coming off of benzodiazepines and the withdrawal sends me in even more anxiety. I had this app on my phone for a while but never used it... Until now. The calm and soothing voice of the speaker along with his instructions sent me to the most relaxed place on the planet.  I've never felt more relaxed while awake. I will start to do this daily... Maybe several times a day.      ,Brilliant Thanks for this great app. I've now put my boss onto it and it's spreading around the workplace. ..brilliant!      ,"OMG &lt;3 This app is amazing!!! I have a hedgehog and shes SO LOUD at night! But then I put this app on I fall right asleep :D and STAY asleep! This is a life, and sleep saver! I'm going to be a high school student soon and this will help me get a much deeper sleep throughout the year. Thank you sooooo much for giving me my sleep back!!!!! &lt;3      ","Really helped with my anxiety. I have this overwhelming fear of anaphylaxis, and was having an episode. After listening, I was completely carefree! Such a good thing, natural and easy.      ","Seems hokey at first.. My mom said I just had to get this app, naturally I rolled my eyes and said it sounded like a crock. She wore me down and finally got me to try it. It was weird at first but after a couple times I became comfortable and it does help me relax.. which is no easy feat      ",Thank you so much Thank you Andrew for this amazing app. I have had trouble for many years with sleep anxiety. Your app has truly changed my life. After 2 weeks of falling asleep with very little anxiety myself and psyc are considering very slowly reducing my tablets which I am so pleased about. Thank you so much. I look forward to buying ans trying your other apps.      ,"Very good Its a quick, relaxing body scan with a little extra. It totally helped me calm down on an especially stressful and overwelming day. I'm impressed as I've never had something like this work so well on me. Only giving 4 stars because of the end... I wish there was an option to either stay calm OR wake up. The first time I listened, i became tense during the closing part. I was wide awake again and bummed. A+ on his voice!!      ",great app As I suffer from chronic pain I get little sleep since using this app for relaxing over the last couple of weeks I have found I feel more 'in control' of my life and am beginning to regain my sense of humor. I get a bit more sleep and so am able to deal better with the stress and pain. I enjoy Andrews voice and amazing accent would prefer the counting up to ten to be a bit quiter but that is a minor niggle. Thanks for a wonderful app      ,Super helpful!   This is really amazing!  At first I thought it would never work and downloaded it for fun and did it in my garden only to realise it really works ans helps so much! This changed my views on things a d made me totally amazed  I use this app now alot and find jt extremely helpful !!  I have also  noticed im more awake and aware in class ans have been getting better grades!  This is just amazing and I would be more than happy to pay for more of Andrew Johnson s apps. The music os also very soothing thanks x       ,Scottish! Nice change I have listened to dozens of recordings like this one and for the most part enjoy it.  Easy to listen to the lull of his gentle brogue and become deeply relaxed.  Gave only 4 stars because I do use this at night to fall asleep and being pulled (counted) out so energetically snaps me awake. Often hard to get back to that relaxed spot again. A more gentle approach would earn that 5th star. App works great for my DROID X.      ,Love this app I use this app quite frequently because I have bad insomnia. It really helps me cut out the noise and find myself comfortable and ready to sleep. I highly recommend it. I also enjoy the Deep Sleep one.      ,Very easy to use when you struggle to go to sleep Lovely soothing soft scottish voice will guide you in relaxation mode and stop your mind from working overtime when you should be resting.      ,"Just wish there were more It's a fantastic app, and it works exactly as it's supposed to. I'm just waiting for an update that might give us more of Andrew!      ",Helps with stress Love this program. It is so easy to use and works. When my kids are napping helps me to recharge for the rest of the day..  Thank you so much for making this program      ,AMAZING! An amazing app I have used many times over the past few years and would highly recommend to anyone! Outstanding work from Andrew Johnson.      ,"Excellent! Great app, BUT when counting to 10 at the end, it's pretty loud and disturbs the calm and peacefulness. Recommend being more gentle and using a softer tone at the end.      ","Brilliant! Ok so I am a carer for my partner and need some 'me' time to relax! I downloaded this before and just come back to it on my new phone, I can honestly say it relaxes you so much and I could feel my head dropping further and further. Also don't panick if your new it won't knock you out it just helps you to get past the initial relaxation. Thank you Andrew you very clever Scott:-)      ","Andrews apps are amazing Andrews voice is so relaxing, put together extremely well, very effective. Thanks Andrew      ",". Love, love, love this app! 9/10 puts me to sleep, and fast. Mission accomplished!      ","Short and amazing This is a short app which is amazing when used properly like Andrew Johnson suggests, every day for three weeks. However it is not really deep relaxation,  more like quick one but it is still efficient. If yu want deep relaxation then try power nap by Andrew Johnson. It is still an amazing app for normal day to day life stresses.      ","Actually helps It is the only app that I have used that works and helps me to relax and think more positively. Even helps sleep at night, I rarely hear the end of it. Overall really good and helpfull app. I highly recommend it.      ","Unexplanable Ive downloaded seems like at  least a hundred sleep apps but this is then only one that's actually made me fall asleep. I don't even know but maybe the first 3 min of what he says and im out. Not to mention, my best friend always laughed at me for listening to this everynight. So i finally got her to sit down and just try it, out she went! Great job! (:      ",Perfect But why is the exam drep not free??? Please make it free because I'm 17 now.. Can't have my private bank account yet :( and I have exams      ,I like the paid apps better because there is no wake up part at the end.      ,Love it! It's the only thing that helps me feel at ease and actually sleep.      ,"Great after a busy day, or if you just need to wind down.  Also recomend his paid apps, most less than  2.00 and can all be used at any time for that extra boost we all need from time to time.      ",Awesome app I love it. It helps me relax to be able to go to sleep at night or if I'm having a stressful day.      ,Was skeptical at first The first time even halfway through I was skeptical. but then further in to the speaking I was fully relaxed which I did not think was possible after a large cup of coffee. now I use it almost everyday. fantastic      ,"What the hell!??!!! Really!??!! This guy ONLY has 2 free apps!??!! Like I love the relaxation one. Helps me out a ton. But I'm NEVER gonna pay $2 freakin .99 for an app that I can't at least try b4 I buy. This app would have 5 stars, but as I said this dude is SO HARD up for $ that he can't give out a sample of the apps u do havta pay for???? DO NOT pay for those apps. Just go w a free one. Waste of money!!!!!      ",Relax Does exactly what it says. Excellent for taking time out of a busy day to re-charge batteries.      ,"Somewhat effective Please offer the option to play the narrative without the music. It is very distracting to hear the same loop in every recording. I realize that this option will increase the size of the app, but it would be worthwhile.      ","So soothing Whenever I'm in need of sleep, Andrew's voice becomes my lullaby. Works everytime.      ",I loved it! It did what i on my own was unable to achieve- calm my nerves. My only regret is why did i not know about it before?!      ,The one with the ice burg and water It is so soothing i take it to the gym an do my stretching to it and my meditating with earphones soothes like a spa i even play it in my bathroom while i shower. Thank you!      ,Beautiful to relax by love it I had an old Metro phone that had all my music on it but someone sabotaged it so I'm very happy to have something to relax by      ,I cannot possibly say anything wrong nor right! It helped me sleep efficiently and that is what it did! So it contributed!      ,"Rate the app! I have enjoyed it, but lately its been stopping a lot, and wish other music was an option.  Just recently added another app with different music.      ",Amazing I listen to it every morning every night and it's just have to come down so much but I get so angry and the music is so soulful.      ,Relax music I'm a massage therapist and I use it in my home when I have clients over and it's great.      ,"So Relaxing Very peaceful and relaxing, soothing, only think about resting, no conflicting thoughts.

My psychiatrist suggested that I look into practicing Mindfulness and meditation to help me cope with the stress that comes with these illnesses. Thanks to this app, as well as some supplemental reading and research, I've been seeing some great improvements with my mental health! You don't need to live with mental illness in order to get something out of this app, though. Everyone could use some relaxation!      ","Loving it but needs background playing I like the daily reminder, the calendar with the dates you've meditated and also the fact that it shows you how much time you've meditated. In my opinion the the daily meditation of 10 minutes is to short as ~3 minutes it's only the introduction but I'm used to it now. I would give it 5 stars but there's no background playing and I have to keep the display on for the length of my meditation which can take more than 30 minutes so it uses a lot of battery so it would be nice for future      ",Peaceful Calm has helped me find balance through a very difficult part of my life.      ,"Useful for developing mindfulness Simple to use.

This app has been a game changer.  I'm sleeping better and focusing more.  I run this twice a day some days when the anxiety is especially high and it provides me with a quick reset button.

I haven't meditated a lot and have been reluctant to begin as I was having a hard time finding the value of meditating despite ""knowing"" it's benefits. By incorporating 'Calm' into my morning practice I've come to experience the benefits of meditation. Each guided meditation focuses on a concept or idea (i.ethe importance of cultivating patience) and discusses why it's important and how it can be carved into daily life      ","Life changing app! I started using Calm during a particularly stressful time in my life and I have found it invaluable. The guided meditations cover the whole spectrum of emotions, so whether you need a confidence boost or a reminder to have more compassion for yourself and others, there is something for everyone. I especially love the meditation courses offered, having a specific amount of time to set aside each day to complete a course really motivates me to meditate. The deep sleep meditation is great too!      ","Wonderful app! This is really a wonderful app! -If only one wouldn't have to pay for most of the meditations- I love the hostess' voice, so calming and soothing for the guided meditations -except for the one in the free guided meditation it sounded fake and not as soothing- and I love how you at least let us have a little taste every now and then about the payed meditations... ('cause I unfortunately not going to pay for a year of calm) but anyway this app is great and it has really added to my meditation practice!

Clear and rational I tend to be skeptical to a fault. So anything that wanders into oneness and energy and all that really turns me off. This is straightforward and really just about being aware, present, and controlling your reactions and thoughts. Great stuff.      ","VERY RELAXING My 8 yr old and I have gotten into the habit of ending our day with CALM. We both love it, and he actually asks for it. I'm Grateful he's learning to be Mindful at such a young age. Wonderful app.      ","Awesome! A great app!!! The ""songs"" are helping so much with getting & keeping in the right state of mind. I love how at peace Calm makes me after a stressful day. One thing that could use some improvement are the nature sounds. Wind, water, plains of wheat, heavy rain, they all sound a little like static. These sound could be better: more clear and pure. Also the option to not have any sounds would be great. Sometimes I'd prefer silence behind Tamara's voice.      ","Absolutely awesome Been struggling to meditate on my own but with the calm app, it's no longer a struggle. Thanks      ",Highly recommend it My doctor told me about this app and it's been a lifesaver. It helps with my anxiety and helps keep my self esteem in check.      ,"Amazing Life changing, Ive used it everyday for teo weeks now and even purchased their book. It's made an incredible difference in my patience, happiness and relationships. I'm learning to be in the now and also to turn off the constant worrying and run down of to do lists in my head.      ","Minimalist meditation app Gorgeous design and straightforward features makes this a pleasure to use. I tend to stick to the basic timers and love that they let you start at 1 and 2 minutes. Their guided meditations are decent if you need some hand holding. After 10+ years of trying to form a meditation habit, this app is what finally worked for me!      ","Love it! Own it! Within just 5 days, I get accustomed to meditation. Thanks to Calm app! It has helped me develop awareness, focus, being mindful in daily life and learn to take care of my health by sticking to mindfulness meditation regularly. Thank you!

It helps him sleep at night, and helps him control his anxiety.        ",Calm Exellent app very well thought out very effective would have expected a bit more consideration with the upgrades and payments expensive would be good karma to rethink business model for this app  otherwise top marks x      ,Dedicated To take time for myself allows love.  Thank you Calm for offering this service to soulful time      ,peace of mind excellent app. provides peace of mind. great source of meditation and energy transformation      ,"A great meditation tool I've tried meditation on and off for a few years now, and Calm has really helped my practice.  The soothing music, the option between guided and unguided meditation, the different concepts they introduce, and the calendar are all designed with a superbly light touch, to give just enough support.  Highly recommended.      ","Great way to start my Day! Most mornings I use the guided meditation. When I just want to have their lovely,  calming background noise I will use the timed session. I really am much more calm and focused throughout my day.      ",Best guided meditation Best guided meditation I've ever used and it's totally worth the money. I use abo it every day and there are so many options!!!      ,"I use it everyday It brings a variety of meditation practices, from short to longer ones. I use to do one conducted meditation per day, but you can also set the timer and meditate all by yourself.      ","Just what I needed Dealing with the anxiety and stress of daily life has been a challenge for me. Years ago, I used meditation and relaxation techniques, which really helped. I had not been able to get back into those practices until I found this app. Having the guided programs that this app provides gives me what I need to get back into it again. Now I look forward to each upcoming session, and the difference it has made is very noticeable.      ",I absolutely love this app. I just wish I could turn off the screen and still have the music playing in the background.      ,Changes everything! //UPDATE: I love the new Daily Calm meditations!!! Can we make them in 20 minute version by just adding extra unguided minutes?// I have been using Calm a few days a week for a year now. I am now up to 20 minutes a day every day and it really has helped increase my ability to respond mindfully to whatever hapens during the day. It really works!      ,"Great app, but drains battery I have this on my phone and my Nook tablet. I plug in my phone on and off over the course of the day, but never had to with my Nook until I installed this app. That being said, I really like the dimmer screen when reading in the evening and before bed. Sometimes I'll turn it off to take a screenshot or see something in greater detail and the screen will be so bright I'm amazed that I used to read at that level! I highly recommend this for anybody who is on their phone or tablet before bed.      ","What I needed. Been using for a while now, there is no doubt that it does do what it says it does. Only problem is the drain on battery.      ","Works I'm able to fall asleep much easier now even after reading a book on my phone. Very easy to use and set up. I like the options of having it an always, to turn on when the sun goes down (this is how mine is set) or custom set time. I've been using it for about 13 months.      ","Love it! It's awesome. I've been using it for a couple of weeks, and I pretty much can't live without it. Please make an app for my dumb iPad too please!      ",Niiice Sleepy an extra hour. This app actually got me to sleep early without effort. And I actually planned to stay up. Nice job indeed. :-)      ,"Good app but not sure if I trust privacy The app works perfectly. However, Snapchat friends started to get texts from me saying ""you should check out the Twilight app"". I never sent these and only found out when people started responding asking what I was talking about. I've since removed permissions for twilight because I'm not sure if I can trust it.      ","Would like to see option to remove the notification bar The app is great, it allows me to still fall asleep when using my phone in bed. Only improvement that I would like to see is an option to disable the notification bar. It takes up valuable space that is unnecessary.      ","Keep your power! Saves your battery,  no more constant re- charges love it.      ","It's pretty good Only thing I'm missing is that I have omni swipe app installed (like pie, quick gesture buttons) the filter does not apply to it. what can I do about that? Thanks for any help :)      ","Does not work for me :( I honestly haven't noticed a difference when it comes to me falling asleep faster at night. I use my tablet a lot too. That was the big reason why I installed this app. I must be the only one because everyone is praising it. If it works for other people, great - but it doesn't work for me so I am gonna have to uninstall this.      ","This app helped me SO MUCH ! After using this app for a while now ,my eyes  stopped hurting after reading for few hours and I love how gentle is the light at night .I don't feel like the screen's light is piercing my eyes .I strongly recommend it !      ","Has minor problems on my Moto x Great app but has some problems on my phone. I'm running lollipop on a Moto x and the app is not applying the filter over the whole screen all the time. It doesn't dim the buttons on the bottom, notifications that pop up on the top of the screen and also the whole emoji page in my text app (textra). Please fix those issues.      ","Awesome Have loved it since I got it, but just noticed it especially when I got a new phone and it wasn't in there yet.  My eyes just about jumped out head seeing blue screen at night.  Reinstalled and back to peaceful,  rest inducing night time reading.      ",Give a good rest in my strained eyes! Recently my eyes feeling way more tired and blurry after reading emails or articles from my phone. Just remembered that there might be an app which can reduce blue LED and make it easy to the eyes! First came up from the app list and I have been enabling this red overlay always because the blurry sensation has reduced quite a lot !      ,"Really works I am a big time skeptic of things like this, but this app inarguably worked for me--I very noticeably start getting ""heavy eyes"" a good hour earlier than I did before.  Really happy I found this.  NOTE:  Due to an Android anomaly, you need to pause the app in order to update apps on Amazon.  Very easy to do, just something you need to know.      ","Twilight I hit the play button and lower the phone brightness and the magic of the pinkish screen helps me relax after reading for a bit, and it actually tends to help me sleep better. You must try it and share this app with others!!      ",Meh? This thing never turns off even though I've set the timer four times. I have to keep pausing it. I don't know if my phone is crap or the app is. Otherwise it's insanely helpful at night. If I knew what the problem was I would rate higher.      ,"Really helped Although I didn't actually see a difference in when I woke up or got to sleep, when I did wake up in the morning, I felt more awake and fresh than I ever had done. Really liked this app and would definitely recommend this      ",Doesn't work as it should I have to open it and choose the option: always. Everytime I want it to work . Automatic startup is not working so it wastes my time .I will download another app that works on my phone      ,"Not just 1 but many hours increased. Being on the fine line of about to be an insomniac.. I actually could work whole night(till sunrise). The work was mainly with mobiles and PCs, I had concluded that my biological sleep cycle had been destroyed completely. But this app actually did wonders. Within few days I reverted back to normal or I would say a much better state than I ever was just because of this app.      ","Great app but be warned: This app screws up lots of my other apps. For example, you can't use Lyft when Twilight is running. You also can't install apk files while Twilight is running. It's really strange and I spent hours trying to figure out what on earth was going on. It's sad but i'll have to uninstall this app because of it.      ",I love this app. Sometimes I forget how great it is until I pick up my iPad in bed and it's like someone has a flashlight in my face. I literally recommend this to anyone that owns an android.      ,"Turns everything blue when off It is very easy on my eyes at night, but right when  I turned it off to let it not run continuosly, It appears blue to my eyes and I feel that it isn't supposed to do that. It's a cool app but, I'm uninstalling because it doesn't make me tired and the blue is bothering me and I don't want my eyes worsening than they already are since I have bad vision.      ",Insomniac I have trouble drifting off and often find myself grabbing my phone as a distraction. The relaxing hues are very soothing and not harsh like normal cell illumination.      ,"Cool app I don't know if it's just a placebo, but I've been falling asleep faster since I downloaded this app.      ",Love it!   This is absolutely amazing! Set to automatic & gives my eyes a much needed break during the evening use on my phone. Less strain & better night sleeps! Even adjusts my Fossil Q smart watch display perfectly! Just wish it didn't screen shot with the filter....      ,"Not working correctly since update Used to be 5 star app but since last update, it's not working correctly. It works at night which is great but in the morning it's brighter than my phone is normally. I've had to change the custom time so it goes back to normal screen before I wake.      ","Love it This is a great app. It has helped me considerably as I have difficulty feeling sleepy and getting to sleep, so while I dawdle on my phone, I'm not blasting my eyes with blue light. You can feel the relief instantly :)      ",This is awesome! The app is awesome! I like the sunrise and custom time selections and that you can exclude certain apps from being filtered. The filter can be adjusted and I like that it is highly customizable.      ,Love this! It is easy to use and really makes a difference. I feel okay to use my phone later at night without it being too stimulating. The red is so relaxing. Like cosy candlelight.      ,"Nice app! Made a huge difference. I'm bad about being on my phone at night, I've noticed a real difference with this app. It truly does what it says and keeps me relaxed. Thank you for helping me literally not stay up on my phone for hours wasting precious sleep time any more!      ","Almost perfect I love this app, I think eye health is very important and I hate to get headaches looking at my phone late at night. I want to give this app full stars because I really think it is fantastic. I just have one problem with it: when Twilight is on and I am on the Internet on my phone, it blinks on and off periodically. It is very annoying and the long stretches of switching off makes it almost pointless to use.      ",No difference All was well until it stopped actually dimming my screen after the last update. I barely even see a red tint and it makes my screen BRIGHTER. I'm extremely disappointed. It was once so useful. No matter how I tinker with the settings it won't change.      ,"So far, the best app I've found I tried many apps before this one and I have to say this is the best one. I'm still not a 100% happy with it because it's not exactly what I'm lookin for. I don't just want a dimmer, I want a Night Time Filter that adjust things so I can read but I don't get my eyes burnt. But like I said, this is the closest thing I've found among all other paraphernalia of apps you'll see, plus I like its friendly design, that's a nice touch. So, save yourself sometime ad try Twilight.      ","Excellent! A great idea, well executed and improving with every update. One does wondering why 100% black goes a bit red though.      ","Help The screen overlay on this app prevents me from using some apps and I need to disable the screen overlay to allow permission for apps then re-enable the screen overlay. It's just ridiculous, talk about jumping through hoops. Please fix this.      ",It does exactly what I need it to do. Not much else to say. It works perfectly on my Galaxy S4. It lets me dim my phone's screen more than I usually can and gets rid of all the painful blue light. I even use it when I drive do it doesn't affect my night vision.      ,"Dreaming Again Haven't been able to dream since my brain got fried , gained way more then 1 hour , woke up this morning instantly refreshed , been using around 3 months now .      ","Good app but interferes with other things I enjoy using this app however now and again I have experienced unusual situations with it switched on, for example my online banking app uses its own onscreen keyboard and this app stopped it from registering inputs. However after pausing the app everything went back to normal, so make sure you remember to try that before contacting support on the apps it breaks (like I did).      ","Sight Saver I love to read e-books after sunset till 10pm and there were nights when I felt like my eyes were burning or pulsing in an uncomfortable manner, this app lifted me from worry and makes it easier to fall asleep as well, one time I accidentally fell asleep reading, but it was midnight   . I'd love to see this as a desktop app, because I do a lot of office work and some gaming on the side and even at the computers lowest brightness setting, it still has a uncomfy feeling for my eyes. Great app tho, Cheers!      ",Always stops Ididnt set any time to stop but it stops after just a minute every time. Loop mode does not work. Please fix it fast. Ive given 3 becoz u have added concentration beats do not remove it in update      ,*Updated* Resolved :~) Broke on last update *updated*.  As requested I reached out to support again and they were able to resolve the issue.  I am so glad as this is hands down the best app I have found for sounds to help me sleep.  I fill the bigest advantage with this app is that you can custom make the sound combinations &  control each sound level independently to create that perfect mix that works for you. Resolved :~) Broke on last update. I reached out to support but got no response. Guess Im out of luck. Resolved! :~)      ,"I have trouble sleeping but this app helps me relax and fall asleep much easier and quicker, I absolutely love it and never had any problems with it either, different options of sounds cater for diferente individuals 5*      ",Pretty good Some of the musical samples start in the middle of a bar and then change suddenly in the middle of the song. Sometimes the Dynamic volume is too great between the softest instruments and the loudest instruments. If the samples could be a little longer that would be great.      ,"Wonderful Relaxation I also use it for meditation. I love the timer option and how it gently fades out. A wonderful app. Update: May 2016 and I am still using this app. I have had no problems. Love the soothing, gentle sounds and so peaceful       ","I've tried many noise generating apps, deleted most, and liked a handful enough to keep and pay for premium. Out of those, this is the one that spends the most time in my quick-access app tray. The sound quality is good, and the loops are pleasant, interesting, and varied enough to create a remarkable spread of sound environments for many purposes. Most helpfully, as a worrywart, it lets me fall asleep without getting caught in stressful thought patterns, and keeps me asleep despite noisy neighbours.      ",Worth the $ To someone who is very keen on subtle sounds in the recordings. It could use just a bit of fine tuning on some sounds but overall it's amazing. Icy rain has some strange sound in it that is not natural. And the loop of the bubbles is far to close.                                       Thanks for getting back so fast. Customer service is key in progress and feeling heard is another. Keep up the great work. Changed 4 star to 5 star review.      ,Awesom  but it could be better if.... The best app ever for sounds .... I could mix melodies together and feel them ... so nice and collective ... LOVE IT . But I wish you can make an update in which I can go out of the app and still hear the melodies      ,"This app is lovely   Purchased the full version @rs. 100  ... It's worth paying . One request please improve the sound quality ( although quality isn't bad), all sounds are 80kbps .ogg, make them 320kbps and increase volume too. Thank you, now let me sleep          ","This app has cured my insomnia and bettered my workouts and meditations. Not only is there a sleep timer to turn off the sounds but you can set it to turn the app off too, saving battery consumption. The melodies are lovely and relaxing.      ",Fantastic I initially got this app to help put my kids to sleep & ended up putting it on my phone as well to help me sleep      ,It's really awesome... hats off to this appmaker I usually don't give review on apps ... but I couldn't resist to review this one ... really soooo pleasant and soothing music of different categories ... takes u back to the nature ... must listen ... worth downloading ... helps my meditation a lot      ,Use it every night My wife and I can't sleep without this. Sounds especially good on my Nexus 5x. Free version.      ,"It worked fine till I bought the full app ,now all I get is a buzzing sound,sent a letter in requesting some still ain't heard from these fools goin on 3 weeks now!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!      ",I really enjoy this app. It helps me relax and get to sleep every night.      ,Was good... Sounds that were free are now locked and need to buy the app to use them... deleted      ,Effective and efficient response They are fast replying and do their best to respond and solve issues at an amazing rate. Rarely seen today. Thank you for your patience and assistance.      ,"Works like a charm Between this and my other sleep aid app, I sleep like a baby. Love it.

When I feel restless I turn the app on and I am asleep before the timer shuts the app off.      ,Great selection I upgraded and have not been disappointed! Previous review: I love how many options it has on the free version! I'll probably upgrade soon to the paid one because it is so reasonable. The music!sounds are great quality and I like all of them.      ,Music and nature sounds are really good I use it every night      ,Amazing for Relaxation and Sleep Aid A great free app that I use almost every night to help me get to sleep. It works like a charm. Let's you design your own combination of sounds and relaxing music and save as favorites. A must have app if you are looking for a white noise for sleep or just for relaxing background music!      ,Excellent Checked it out for ten mins. Upgraded without hesitation. Love it. Thanks.      ,Sleep better Love this app. I really like that you can customize the melodies you want together.      ,Helps me get to sleep! I love it      ,"The best sleep, and relaxing app I have ever found. The only one I use on night after night      ",Basic relaxation sounds The basic sounds are not bad to listen to. Some are a little tinny. Great background sounds for study.      ,"Can't sleep without this app!! I downloaded this so my daughter could fall asleep, and now I'm stuck. I've used this for a couple years now, and I love it. Even my mom loves it and it has improved her sleep quality. I have a later work schedule and she doesn't even hear me get home. This app is awesome!      ",Love this!!! This app put me right to sleep during the night from when I had problems falling asleep :)      ,"Use it ALMOST every night I enjoy the app immensely. Needs more free sounds. That being said, the Devs' are actually on top of their app. Good Job      ","The app is nice, but title is misleading As a student music therapist, I can see myself using this app for my relaxation sessions, but I can assure everyone this is NOT music therapy. We go to college for a continued 4 years minimum, study many of the subjects our nursing, occupational therapy, and many other health profession students study. We cannot be replaced by an app, but we constantly fight this stigma. I would enjoy this app more if it didnt have a misleading (and in some ways illegal) title, and hope that the makers consider change it.      ",This that sucks None of the sounds are relaxing it just I don't lie I don't like it at all it just sucks I mean really put some actual relaxing music in      ,"All piano I like it for about two minutes, until the whole soothing sound turned into piano playing. Didn't find it relaxing at all!!      ",Doesn't work on MotoX 2013 Lollipop This used to be a must have for me. After the upgrade the app seizes to function. No music. Just a frozen screen. Fix this and you have 5 stars from me.      ,"Love it! It can be used for many things... Sleep, Relax time, Nap time for children... I have even put it on while cleaning my house or driving in my car... I give it a 5... However, it could be improved. By additional sounds, shuffle, and add your own... But to be free, It's Awesome!      ","Yes!!! I'm already an insomniac, and now I'm pregnant. Sound sleep is hard to come by. I am a chronic TV on at night sleeper and it usually just seemed to keep me up. I liked the noise, but it was distracting. Also, I live in a not so quiet neighborhood. That being said, I feel asleep in less than 20 minutes with this app. I love that you can personalize the sounds. Floating in the city with waves added was perfect. It does drain the battery a bit, but that's to be expected if you're playing it all night. Get it!      ",Was nice until you can't turn piano off Hate sleeping to piano. You can adjust the volume to all the good sounds but not the piano music. Killed the app for me. I'll keep searching for a great non piano sleep app. What a shame.      ,Love it Only thing that I've found that not only relaxes you but also helps you drift off into a natural sleep      ,Great App! I loved this great app. It provides soothing & tranquil music making you feel relaxed ready for sleep.      ,"Truly Calming The app is well designed and delivers relaxing, calming sounds.      ",Grateeeeeeeee fantastic app. ifeeling lm in my sweet village in a raining time      ,It's good I have finally found the best app for this kind of tranquil music but it is a bit disappointing as not all of it is free for someone like myself who can't get the paid version coz I can't get an account if this could be updated so all is free then I'll give it the full 5 stars AND recommend it to everyone but other than that it's great love it      ,"Honest feedback...had tried many relaxing music apps, spa music apps etc....this one stands out..absolutely fantastic. very relaxing indeed, gave me goose pimples first time, but subsequently, made me sleep everytime.  The piano music is very good...audio quality is amazing.  see, what more you can improve on..      ","Nice job Pretty good app comparing to others I have tried. There is still room for improvement (mainly on the design) but you did a very good job with the sounds, and with the fact we can play them independently of the songs. Excellent!      ",I LOVE IT Omg the is cool. I have a medical condition that makes me sleep depraved. All I do is take 30 mm of zzz quill and play this and I'm out cold      ,Awesome! I d highly recommend this app for everyone. This is really great. Just don't forget to add it to the whitelist in ur task killer application. Great app!      ,WoW!!! There is nothing beter then having a lovely sleep ... but now that i am living in the city there is to much noise and canot sleep ..but this app is the best .it helps me to block out those noises and keeps my mind clear..       ,"Smart Intelligent & Beautiful Can be used while doing so many things like Yoga, Studies, Work in office, Long Drive, For Creating an Ambience  & ofcourse for sleep..      ",Perfect Helps me like nothing else. A must have if you need to slow down your mind to get to sleep. And I love the timer so it doesn't drain my battery.      ,Love it I have really bad insomnia for someone at my young age and my favorite on here is dance of the gossamer. I keep it on repeat for a couple hours and I just lull myself to sleep. I also keep it down low so it's just in the background.      ,Perfect Been using it for about 2 yrs..for myself now my 7yr old...I sleep longer and she sleeps thru the night...something we both couldnt do before .... Thank you      ,"Thank you! I can't sleep without it. Suffering from insomnia for many years, this app has helped me. The song Floating in the City, is the reason why I am able to sleep. Thank you again. Buying full version to support your amazing work.      ",I loved it Relax really...but please the two new sound tracks ...How to get them ..??I downloaded the app before you add them ...      ,"What a croc This didn't work at all, does it require weak minds to cause an effect? Is it like hypnotism?      ",Really works to me I got it very well in my ear and my android. It functioned well and soothing my mind for real. Thanks for the creator        ,"This isn't a rating.  I want to know, before I keep this app, why the app ""needs access to the SMS & the device call information""?  This app seems to good to be true &  positive I would enjoy it but I can't think of a legitimate reason for needed access to anything other than WiFi!      ",Robert Batra Such a boring game. Once when I started this app to get a sweet sleep my sleep was gone away. Horrible. Totally time waste and mood waste app.      ,Wow I have serious insomnia.  Have gone 40 hr sretches without sleep. This app puts me to sleep within minutes and keeps me there for hours with good dreams even!      ,Useful  in relaxing It's usefull to relax and make your mind calm. But not music therapy to sleep      ,Great except it turns off after a few seconds if I lock my phone      ,"INSOMNIAC Hoping to sleep . Had this before dont remember if it helped me sleep or not,  had one that did  ..... hope this one is it  !!!!    NOPE  .   CAN ANY ONE RECOMMEND A GOOD SLEEP APP  ???      ",I've started to have a peaceful sleep after listening to this music...my mind is relaxed & the music is soothing... Thank you!      ,I use it every night to fall asleep and find this app very relaxing.      ,Music are too short Dead air too long before the music start.. But nice overall      ,"Great! Used this app for years (the deluxe version on an older phone). It soothed me thru my good and bad days and nights.  Then a few years later, it became a bigger blessing while I was pregnant.  I will most - likely get the deluxe again.      ","Love, but has changed I have been using this to sleep, as I work nights, for the last 2 years. But before I switched phones, the app would open on the same music choice that I always listen to. After a new phone, I have to find the song and set it to repeat every single time the app opens. THIS IS ANNOYING!      ",relaxing relieves the mind from stress and induces sleep sadly its not all free app      ,Dont like music. Is there a way to hear it without the music??      ,"Awesome app...!!! Tis app is lik my mom... Puts me to sleep everyday... Just one thing tat could be done to improve user experience is to let it play in the background even wen we exit the app... Otherwise, it's too gud...!!! Congrats Dev team for such a lovely app...!!! :) :) :)      ","Good app, to the person saying the title is illegal You obviously don't know how the internet works to suggest that by putting out a free app to help someone sleep they're breaking the law in some way because they used the word ""therapy"". Definition of therapy: ""treatment intended to relieve or heal a disorder"".      ","Be carefull rating this app low they retaliate against ppl who give bad reviews. This game overall 3 stars but I noticed if you give SCOPELY a bad review they will technically  give you a hard time at this game be very carefull, very money oriented,one upgrade at a time you no long er can sell old unused weapons for wood, we're once wood was easy now can't sell for stuff or anything for material. They design this game for buying customers only. They give you 3 star characters for token won, and now that's scarce as well, Very Very carefull buying coins some people don't get what they are promised and end up spending over hundreds of dollars on this app.      ",Characters I tried for the Maggie today and pulled 11 3*s. With so many 4* and 5* I don't understand why you have to get so many 3*. So if anyone reads this don't waste your time keep your money or spend hundreds to get the characters you want. Also look at YouTube and see people pulled 40 and 40 3*s.      ,"Game STEALS your money Originally gave this game 5 stars, but the more you play the more money you have to spend. I bought a raid can and it didn't credit to my account. After numerous emails I was told that it was credited and that I used the refill. Total BS.      ",When i walk the Dead stay Dead This game feels like your directing a episode of AMC Walking dead! Plus resource management and keeping your crew alive.Holy Rotting flesh!I peed myself! Got A code brown! Rick! Give me your cowboy hat!      ,Blown Away It took a minute to get into it.  But once I really figured the gameplay out.... I can't put it down.      ,Have alot of problems loading the dam thing made a great crew now can't play for some reason Can you help us out and let me know what the problem might be I don't wanna lose all my progress      ,Great game but Its not letting me level past 20?? Is that supposed to happen?? I have factionmates that are 30+      ,Expecting Drops Can we please leave the Expecting Loot Drop please. I'm  tired of trying to remember what the drops were. It would help to find guns in certain areas or loot to level up our character's.      ,Could use some improvements. Able to pick up good characters and weapons more easily without having to spend money. People that even spend a lot of cash they still don't receive the better characters.      ,"Very poor management Hard to get on a schedule with this game, makes it very difficult to prepair for events, an 100 bucks is a waist buy something you can have to show for later on, 3 star characters for 100 bucks is whack, this game would make alot more money if they would give a lil bit, once someone loses that much money odds of em spending again is very slim.      ","Endless Fun This game not only features a choose your own destiny, but also features an Ultimate Team-esque sense to it and also offers what Clash of Clan fans want. All that, you can play for hours before you're forced to wait, but it's an amazing game that I have nothing bad to say about. They hit it out of the ball park with this game.      ","Lies Don't believe the ""free"" Glenn character and that it's a ""$10"" value.  He's original given like it or not from a token that gets you high star characters. Along with ""collecting"" your favorite characters you'll need to have a fatcat wallet to get anything remotely worth wild.      ","Unhappy with Lost progress due to Update Overall I really liked the game , however I've LOST ALL MY PROGRESS INCLUDING MONEY PURCHASES AFTER THE LAST UPDATE . I hope this can be resolved i would still like to play the game. Also I spent money on your game one purchase of the 30 day 70 coins p/ day and only received less than a week's worth which is lost . The screen to start just can't load anymore please contact me and let me know how else I can help you fix the issue it's a great game and the first game I've ever spent money on Thanks      ",Great game Only thing I don't like is that I personally can't find the value of spending too much money on this game.      ,It is a good app to spend some time. The only thing that I am not agreeing upon is the really hard mechanism to get even a 4 star characters. If you don't pay you struggle and it is still not enough. Even the avid players make the app sell further. Time is money as well!!      ,"I love the game, but i think that the use of coins to get 5 star characters is a complete scam. Ive spent quite a bit on the chance. They debut a new epic recruit every day. It is a total scam. They even say oh double the chances. Yet there is no percentage of drop rate. I strongly feel that scoplay is being extremly greedy and scaming loyal players. And should be ashamed! The stars are soley for the great gameplay. But scoplay should be handing out refunds and appoligies like they roll out epic characters.      ","Good game, cool illustration Stingy game designers. Epics far too rare, as in too low of a drop rate. We know where the designers have their eyes set: upon the money.      ","Could be so much more I play Walking Dead, and well, the service for this game sucks.  Bad customer service, poorly designed features, and bait and switch character purchase mechanics.  Items one and three are directly related.  I went to the in game character purchase section.  Here, they have three different character screens and a weapons screen - Premier Characters (four and five star characters with special attributes and abilities.  Often big name characters from the comic book and the games from TellTale), Elite Character      ","Need my game back Hey scopley I just received a brand new tablet today and downloaded this game on it, I play it on my phone everyday and am quite far on it I used y same email address and everything but it's making e start from scratch, I would appreciate it if you could resolve this an give me my game back I can give account code of my profile if you need it? -xander      ","Great, but... I think it's a great game but can u mabye add the fear the walking dead characters. If u do that would be really cool. Thanks.      ",It's like a drug You play it for free. Then you find yourself buying a few things. Next thing you know the only way you can play is if you pay more money.      ,Fun & Addicting! Really fun game to pass the time with and if you watch the show it tells a relatively close but different story. Only negative I see with the game is that Daryl isn't an obtainable character.      ,Love the game even though it's a total rip off and misleading. The odds on winning any tournament / war etc are basically 0%  there is always the same top 5-10 factions winning everything with whole 5* teams . The people and factions who are not massively lucky in obtaining 5*s from spending great amounts of cash don't stand a chance in winning one. I suggest that they need to make it more fair by taken the top 10 factions/ rank 11-20 rank 21-30 aso... From all regions and put them all together. That way it's more of a fair game .      ,Waste of time ! It takes FOREVER to get a strong enough person to battle with. Not sure how long since i dont have one yet. On verge of quiting. Takes up ALOT OF SPACE ON PHONE snd you get nothing out of it. Play week after week month after month and spend gold and still can't get strong enough character to complete stages with . If you want to THROW MONEY away have at it this is the game for you. You would think they would give you a daily log on bonus like other games but the CHARGE $10 for it here.      ,"Cool game As a fans of TWD I love the concept of the game, unique and has a storyline, raids and mission, however buying gold in store is expensive, I'm in the philippines and only use smart billing so it cost much because of the 12% vat.      ","You screw over loyal players You want people to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on this game but you CONSTANTLY screw them over and give them nothing in return. This $10 a month deal isn't even worth it because after saving up all thos coins, you people will still only give most of us 3 star people. Will never give you people one more dollar until you stop screwing over the players      ",This game is ridiculously addictive. But it doesn't demand all of your attention just an hr a day lol      ,This company is a rip off dont play this game Its funny how we are all complaing about how this game is a rip off and these idiots dont even have the guts to reply back to us this comoany is getting rich off the walking dead too bad kirkan couldnt sue them      ,Very addictive.. but.. Been playing for almost three months now and i have no complaints with regards to the gameplay or the graphics.. it never freezes and loads very fast. But you need to pay atleast 3000 pesos for you to advance and compete with the other players who payed. Im from the phillipines so its very expensive for a 10% chance on getting an elite character.      ,Sucks This game sucks it's no different then any other game you find on Google play. You have to join a group and people can attack you just like ever other game this game sucks its stupid!!!!! I'll stay with my walking dead no man's land instead it's been the best one so far then any game I have found on Google play!      ,"Wow Its a grinder game of repeating the same thing, and building a garden could take 12+ hours. Only the paying customers win any events, and you have to spend over $100 bucks to get someone halfway decent. The rate of getting a 5* character is 1/100, and you are more likely to get a 3* piece of crap.      ","Money Rip Off!!!! Unless you're spending tons of money or one of their programmers hacking, then this game just gets disappointing and stupid... They rip you off and won't even work with you. I want my money refunded!!!! You can delete my account if that's what it takes!      ","Great game! Edited 2nd April-  I've come to notice that it's nearly impossible to win the higher leveled missions and side quests the game offers. The minimum level of some of them are A++, and even S1 and beyond. But those levels are nearly impossible to win unless you have maxxed out 4 star and 5 star characters. It's rare to get those characters through free pulls, and leveling them above tier 3 is impossible without either winning or purchasing elite leveling gear.      ","Addicted and spent no money I love this game. You can go all out and buy everything once you really get into it, but for me I just love playing and not taking it too seriously at the moment. Even though I have not spent any money on it I still get rewards and really enjoy the game.      ","Takes way too long to upgrade, and not enough extras to level up...need to spend way!!! too much money and get the same crap elite extras...been playing the game since it came out and still could only upgrade one 4 star character... Getting old now, and spent over 500 on coins...willing to spend the money if it's worth it Would like it more if didn't take so long to upgrade things or take so much to do so and should get better rewards for missions, especially road map...spent 1000s of coins only to get a player I could earn after a month... ....kinda ridiculous....also should tell you what the top upgrade is for characters, upgraded several that were unnecessary      ",Love the game BUT I am currently pretty upset because I installed the game on my tablet and it lost all my progress except my coins and region. I really enjoy the game and worked hard to do well at it only to be left with nothing now. Be very careful about trying to move device.      ,Terrible customer service. Ripped off I spent over 400 dollars on this game. I know wtf? But I was a top player in a top faction. When I switched devices it made me start all over even though it's the same account and all my achievements and payment history  is still on the game. I have sent at least a half dozen messages for at least 3 days and no one has responded. Not even a spam response. I called Google play and they are willing to refund my money. However they will not contact the developer for the issue.      ,No such thing as buying and elite character. Fun game but this system for buying new characters is extremely flawed. Will never spend a dime on this knowing if I ever did I would be baited then switched to an awful character after being advertised something much better.      ,I enjoy game and comraderie found there It would be great to be able to compete with the paying players though. I've found if your not paying to play then you don't get those 4 and 5 star characters....if they change that.  Will give it 5 stars. Well I have gotten some four star character s but 5 star are still unattainable...I will add a star.      ,"Scoplied The game offers many ways to earn coins for offers, but also teaches you to say scoplied instead of screwed when you constanly get screwed on most chances of decent characters, otherwise good game love it.      ",It's my favorite mobile game but seriously arena cheats you by giving the opponent way more turns. You will be shocked when they get 3 to 5 turns per monster while you get 1 turn and maybe 2 once in a while.

Crystals and mana stones are the most prevalent resource but they are nigh unobtainable besides paying for them. The methods they do have to get them in the game; are useless. 30 hours to get 3 crystals, seriously? When it cost 75 to summon and cheapest purchase is 20. Summoning becomes impossible besides the lower level scrolls which say 1-3 stars but more like 1-2. Fun game if your willing to buy your happiness.

Not a bad game and it has definitely had some major improvements since I last played it. I would like trading added however. This could be done by friends only and could use some Mana Stones depending on the rarity of monsters. For example. To trade 5  monsters it could take 750,000 Mana for both participants. 4  could take 275,000, and any below 4  could take about 100,000 Mana.      ","Isn't it a little bit hard to get good monsters?

There is no form of trading whatsoever so basically you are on your own. At first glance I though this may be unfair but the thing is that as you continue to play you develop a team for different things being Raid, Guild Wars, ToA, PvE and PvP there is not such a thing one size fits all in this game. Every monster contributes to a specific roll that being DPS, Tank, Buffer, Healer or Debuffer is up to you to take your team to the next level.

At first I thought this was just a waste of time gathering monsters and skill them up. But I would admit, this is the 1st time I got hook to a game. So hook I even ask my friends to design  our own jacket with our username on it. so that when somebody sees it they would know we play SW wherever we may go. I gave you a 5 star because I think you guys deserve it for creating SW.But sometimes I want to give you a 3 or 4 star because of frustration of stil not getting an NB5 monster when newbies already got it.

Pls fix or buff Juno. This will be the last time. Seara's skills are well paired to itself. Juno's passive with her 1st skill...which increases her atk bar when critical, does not pair at all.

Sometimes i realized that there are two different battleworld in a day but sharing same amount of entry which is 20.

Its actually a pretty good game. Got it to kill time but now I play it everyday.      ,Was great. Not so much anymore... After playing this game since just after inception I have to say I am disappointed. I put a lot of time to rank characters close to maximum. Then World boss is added... The characters I spent so much time on don't even put a dent in the characters they have added. Why play a game that there is no chance of you getting anywhere without dumping tons of money into it.

It also needs a defend button instead of holding the attack button.      ,"Needs better gamepad support From what I've seen of the game it's good, however it needs a customisable control scheme for game pads. The touch controls are fairly clunky and awkward to use, so I play with a Razer sabertooth and the default (and unchangeable) control scheme is hugely impractical.

Probley make a expansion map pack for a bigger world and larger bosses more demons and add dragons and one more thing make it turn to dark winter sunny rainy and snowy.

Finally i wished there should be and option to tone up the graphics for more powerful devices ( higher res textures and models ) if they fixed these issues  i would easily give it 4 stars      It sucks Game is fun and i liked it before it started to kick me out. The game developer have not responded my request to fix it or refund my money. I feel like i chuck ten dollar bill to the toilet and flush it.      ,"Only complaint Controllers. I only rate this 2 stars due to the fact that you lied about the controller support. Nvidia shield controllers- One of the most common- aren't supported. Well at least they break your game... Lemme explain. When you start it up, there is an option to use a controller, having one hooked up (via nvidia shield portable) I select YES. It then proceeds to take me to a screen with the NORMAL moving menu background except without any options to do any thing. (Load game, new game, ect.)      ","Good. Graphics and controls are all right but as a game it lacks some development. The stealth system is primitive based on distance instead of vision. The story is poorly developed with quests like 'I need your help,  kill one bear'. Maybe Ravensword 3 will be a great game, this one is fun but nothing special.      ",Best FP RPG This is the best first person RPG I have found so far (for a phone). Will have to check if these guys have other titles.

Only issue is that the moga gamepad doesn't always want to work with game      ","Rip off It would be fun if I could actually play it. The game gets stuck on the ""powered by unity"" screen. Waste of money. Plz fix or at least give me a refund.      ","Great game, Must buy If you like skyrim, you'll enjoy this. It's about the closest thing to skyrim on a mobile device. I've had a lot of fun while playing it!      ","Looks interesting Game is kind of interesting but seems to fail to properly start when you select to use a bluetooth controller. I've tried a moga controller in both A and B mode. In A mode it starts but controls don't work. In B mode it stops at the title screen with no text. Developer, Please change the method to which controller support is enabled to allow the menu to load first rather than at start up.      ","Get it - that simple. Be aware, the game was released before it was finished - very low on content.  But, it has the potential to be best game ever, though it needs more - a lot more content. It feels half done, like they planned more quest, but never got around to it.  I've lowered my review 1 star because of this - I've been waiting for months, but I have a feeling they are done.  Too bad.      ","A lot of tuning up to do...for mobile it's an amazing feat...but not the game. The game is just a vivid reminder of where were going in mobile gaming. Tune the graphics a lil, as big as areas are it really is more linear than free roam. Tune the controls, for one they're too slow. I could care less how big and graphically good a carnosaur is if I'm turning like I had a stoke when fighting him. Huge game for Mobile RPGS.      ","Pretty awesome.

I bought this to play a good rpg with my new moga pro. It shouldn't be advertised as having moga support when it DOESN'T! Tried restarting several times with no change. Tutorial is all for screen controls, and there's absolutely no response from the controller. And judging by other responses it's not just me. Please fix moga issue and I'll improve my rating.

I have noticed that triggering your character's special abilities has begun to lag a lot more than when the game first came out (minus 1 star). My biggest complaint is the load time. It takes almost 2 minutes (1min 55sec) from the time you start the app until you reach a screen that you can interact with (minus another star). For the amount of space this game takes up in your device, it should load a lot faster.

I love the sound effects and music and everything that makes this game feel like you're in the Star Wars universe.

Gameplay: 2.5 (interface is often wonky, errors occur frequently, force closes happen weekly.)  Freemium: 4 (it's hard but you can complete the game without paying for anything.  But it will take FOREVER.  That's not an exaggeration, end game requirements will force you into direct competition with people who have been playing since launch and you have to rank in Sector Battles for ""Event Crystals"" to meet upgrade requirements.)  Sector Battles: -2 Competing directly against people who have been around so long they have literally every item in the game, is hard.  But to get the advertised Force abilities or Lightsaber you WILL have to compete for event crystals.  Even then, it will take months.  Customer Support: -75 (a team of rabbits weasels with sore teeth would be more friendly and helpful.  They treat you as if you're a liar trying get over on them because their game is perfect.  Of course, when the ""multi award wimming"" game director, their boss, calls people who give harsh feedback a bunch of whiners, what do you expect?)  Pass this game up.      ","It's Great Loved it! The game has everything I looked for organization, beautiful graphics, balanced gameplay (except where the story missions are always a level above you and you can't get instantly to that certain level please fix that I know its a marketing strategy but I just hate that)  and its just wonderful and um one more thing I use to play Spirit Lords and this is a total copy I know its by the same maker but you guys need more creativity otherwise Its great.      ","Update: Was a good little game... Deleting after giving devs time to fix the mess they'd made. Upon the last update, the devs were inundated with serious gameplay issues. Apparently no beta testing used before imposing a game-play  ruining update. I'm pleased a couple issues (not most) had been addressed from their last update, but as a whole gameplay is laggy, costly (time/investment) and PAINFULLY tedious to watch goals/returns  get further and further away.      ","Only game that penalizes you for leveling You have to farm. A lot. Farming gives xp. Xp gives levels. Levels force you to farm more difficult missions before you have upgraded gear to reliably farm previous ones. Also... competative reward system eliminates you if you arent on a good device, before you even try.... the storyline is very giod though. Pretty much the only reason i still put up with the above and slow load times. Those are the worst of any game i have played      ","Typical carrot on a stick Simple progression grinder, nothing special but an adequate time killer. Just do not spend any real money on it, outrageous prices for scant reward, they are essentially pushing pixelated heroin for junkies, relying on impulse buying. Just accept you will not get any where fast in this obvious cash cow and be patient. When South Park did the freemium gaming bit, they were satirising games like this, so fair warning. The controls in this game are really poor, often taps not registering or the character not going to the designated point. That is really the only difficulty i've found in this game, fighting the controls is what makes the game any challenge, and this is not how it should be. The challenge should come from well designed content.      ","Weak and Oversized Gameplay is obnoxious & convoluted. Story drones on without any plot in sight. Visually mediocre. And that's without reaching the multiplayer aspect yet. From what I'm reading in other reviews, I'm glad I never got that far. And it takes up a few gigs of space which could be used for far better things. Forget it. If it wasn't Star Wars, it'd only get 1  .      ","It's a trap! Turns into a job. They dangle the saber in front of you like a carrot and it gets farther and farther away. I've played for months and I wish I never started, it's like a heroin addiction. Once you're invested, they got you. They make nearly impossible missions to get your saber which are endlessly frustrating, and the censors censor everyday words. Gives way too many common items at the premium crane. Real money gets you worthless  garbage. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. SAVE YOURSELF. Fk u Kabam!      ",Awesome So much fun.

Other than that, a fun and addicting game. Wish more time was spent on polish.      ",Too much memory Good game.played it awhile ago.best star wars game on the app store along with kotor but i dont see how anyone is able too play it i was able to delete everythibg on my phone and install it but the files after installation and moving game to sd are making it impossible.i had almost 900mb for the afterwards files and that still wasnt enough.very frustrating      ,Dont work It says installing then next thing u know it tells me im out of space when before it installed i had a lot of space left      ,"Good game but...... In general terms its a good game engine, with a reasonable story line. The grinding does become a bit too tedious though and as you progress through the game a lot of the joy is replaced by pain............. That is unless you are prepared to pay extortionate amounts of cash for in game purchases. Do give it a try though!      ",Upgrade issue Upgrade components don't show up on upgrade screen even though I have them! Please fix it !!!      ,"Huge potential.. But ruined by the company This game needs to be called what it is a single player semi RPG type game. It has great graphics and a good story and a huge potential that is at every turn squashed by the devs for whatever reason. You can in fact play this entire game without any other player interaction but when it comes to making the final upgrades on gear at high levels you must forefit days of your time to community based sector battles just in the hopes of earning an ""event"" crystal or two for upgrading high level gear. Not an MMO!      ","Good but boring This game use to be good but none everything that you want for upgrades takes a month or two to get 1 and then they change it so now you need 5. Also whats the point of having lightsabers in this game when you have to wait 2-3 years leveling up to lvl 100 and then have nothing that can beat you when you do get it. Month or 2 and then im uninstalling if things dont improve, its just another lucas profit driven thing, like the 2 billion profit from posibbly the worst film yet wasnt enough.      ",Waste of time Downloaded the game and the screen is all scrambled no picture waste of time can someone tell me why in sector battles that after 1 hour the leaderboard has over 2 millions points what type of bullshit is this it's impossible it's a scam don't download no light saber why have a picture of an character holding an lightsaber if we can't get one pure B's      ,"I like the game but.. ..seriously, speed up the load times! I have a fast phone too (OnePlus One), but every screen takes forever to load. I've played hundreds of games and nothing takes THIS long!!      ",Chromium and shop system broken This game keeps taking Chromium from me and not giving me the supplies I buy with it. So far it's taken 5 dollars worth.      ,"I originally gave this game 5 stars, but after playing to lvl 90 in 2 different servers, it really got bland.  First, after a server has been around for a good amount of time, you will end up with maybe 2 guilds, and way less than 100 active players. Which gets boring. Second, I started a new server because of that. Well there was a bug, and some players took advantage of it, and were basically removed from that server. In the end, it killed that server, I would say there were maybe 50 or less active players by the time I left. It was completely pointless. My problem is, they keep these servers going, so some noob might join a server, love the game, and actually spend money on runes, just to find out, it's a dead server. They need to merge servers when they get below a certain point, or it makes the game pointless.      ","Update The update isn't allowing me to log in.

",Bo$$ I would play this game till my eyes bleed and I could see no more I would give it a 10 out of 5 stars      ,Hell yeah I love it and I wouldn't ask for anything better but I do think that it would be cool if you raise up the diamonds more instead of winning 1 for each quest within 3-4 battles worth..      ,"A little change never hurt I've been buying 30 gem spawns, All I get is female SSR and I'm a male. Maybe you could make a button where you can change female armour into male and male into female?      ","Good game.  Lots to do and really fun.  The learning curve is pretty harsh, but you'll get the hang of it.      ",Good overall Could be great if the lvl gems came up more once your at higher levels also the gear you get in the beginner spawn are what you are basically stuck with unless you get lucky.      ,This game is addictive It's a very nice RPG war minigame and its awesome until you have to buy stuff like gems bout you need to make money! Edit this game is awesome because theirs always something to do because there are lots of levels to play all day!      ,"Addictive! But.... I got a new phone recently. I recommend using the same google account instead of coding because I had to restart my whole game, making me mad. Other than that, I love this game inside and out. I recommend that for the safety of the creators, in case new players get mad.      ",Awesome Great art. Love the customization.  Relatively easy to level. Good game all around.

The game is really fun, I loved it. But now when I tap to start at the start menu, it just takes me back to the start menu again???

Pretty fun!      ,"Keeps crashing and spawns   Every time I open the chat, it crashes, or it freezes and for the rest of the game i can't type unless i close the app and restart it again, and my spawns 30 gems or 3 gems spent give me the worst items possible      ",Don't normally play these games..

My guild members reported a similar error. Please fix that.

Of course I have many suggestions with the cosmetics, and thing that don't really matter, but other than that this app is great.      ","Pretty Good the only small complaint I have, is you guys may want to try to make a more user friendly interface. It took me a little while go understand the basics, but this is still a great game!      ",Good game... well sort of I liked the graphics but to many weeaboos to count. They make me want kill myself nor than I do now...      ,If you like to have your own personal character with your style and creativity this is the game for you! So many options! And amazing rpg game! 5 star      ,"Item descriptions I love this game, its the game I have probably played the most of. I had an old account that I lost, but when I came back there was no item description besides the battle attributes, and I feels as if it lost some of the fun to getting new items and seeing that funny or cool but of info. Otherwise awesome game all around      ",Cool This the best game ever.

ATEAM IS AMAZE      ,"Good but The game is amazing, addicting, and all around fun, yet, 1 gem for $1.01, that's a terrible deal, someone could do a quick quest, and get that one gem, so, unless you want to close the app down due to lack of money, I suggest you lower the prices      ",WHY CANT WE TRADE     Why is it so hard to get gems like seriously spawn is 30 GEMS and then 50 can't we make it 10 or 20 and I want to be able to trade everything else is amazing but let us trade that's what I want and what others want as well           ,"Wub o.O Amazing,  I play this game now for 2 days and it does so much fun . Great game :)      ",Great Take some getting use to but its becomes a awsome game and easy to play. And its not very pressuring to be good by buying gems untill late game      ,Really great rpg Really nice ui and experience. Well done explanations. Small inventory size is annoying and paying to store items I just paid for tends to be one of the #1 burn out reasons I stop playing eventually.      ,"Great game Lots of fun, love this game! It still crashes occasionally but it's getting better..well worth redownloading though :)      ",Good but.... O.O This game is awesome and all the new updates are GREAT!!! But here the thing is there are way u could put other places to go instead on that one room u should put more rooms where we can chat with friends :] that would be cool bye       ,Can't stop me from playing Best game ever I love this game so much that I sometimes forget about my brothers kidding just joshing I love them      ,Captivating I absolutly love this game when i need to pass time. Its a really fun game except i started to have trouble with it. When ever i go to quest i never actually get to battle cause i keep getting a notice saying connection lost. I tried using it on wifi and my own data but neither seem to help?

Not that active anymore because of this. AND SERVER IS DOWN ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK.      ",Useless updates....

So far one complaint from me, easy to navigate and plenty of rewards to keep you happy! Keep up the good work guys. True, very true. Messing with the level restrictions for the equipment and items might have some bad consequences. It will only take the fun out of it that way. It would be wise to revert back on that aspect. Keep your players happy, old and new.      ",Good game buy The game has a bit of a grindy leveling process but keeps bosses and mobs interesting. Has both pvp and pve content to play and is quite fun to play. Unfortunately the pay to win aspect does imbalance pvp quite heavily      ,Nice game could be awesome if.... You fix unbalanced pvp... Prevent players from quitting PvP or replace player that quit with a bot or deduct gems if player abandons pvp also ban hackers also have a problem with completing daily quests when friends have max hearts...      ,Great game!!!

Tnx.      ,"Not bad @ all So far it seem to be a very nice game. Graphics are good but can be better. It is Avery addicting game.

Giant beast talisman, giant beast talisman, giant beast talisman. C'mon! On to the next item, please!      ",I love this game i just hit level 20 and i already 4 mystic gear equipped      ,"Meh. Liked the pve, but the pvp is pay-to-win like most other freemium games      ","    A MATAEUS REVIEW      I never, ever thought I'd uninstall the original game, but this version has progressed much further in a direction more suited to my tastes. Full props to the original developer for building an excellent foundation, but Shattered feels, to me, like the logical extension of that blueprint. The  only downside? I'd like to see a lot more achievements! Maybe one for each badge? The current ones are rather generic!      ",Very good game Just... Rip Warrior as op class XD      ,Best PD mod ever!!! Very nice update on reworking warrior class =D Hope you can rework or buff Huntress too which is still underwhelming      ,"Perfect Absolutely free, full game. Always being upgraded and made better. I've killed loads of time playing it      ",great like how new things for newest update      ,Awesome! Very addictive!      ,"One of the only fun mobile games I've played Unique toolkit for each class, complex build potential, awesome class mechanic interactions. This game is especially amazing for travels since it requires no internet connection. A+      ","I love it, but it killed the franchise for me. With 1 goal in mind, 100 tries in, desperately, I beat the only boss that drops a persistent item in the game. He does not in this version. Otherwise, this is an upgrade in many ways to the original, I love so many things about this game, but when it comes down to it, I need that drop, and the original doesn't cut it for me anymore, this ruined it, so I guess I quit.      ",One suggestion If mage will have an artifact like an empty spellbook that needs scrolls to be of use then game's heroes will be balanced      ,"Dev: The warrior's badge loses its power when you upgrade to heroic armor.  The warrior's armor should be upgradable. Also, consider having the badge carry two or three upgrades. Right now, the warrior is underpowered because his combos don't give him enough offensive capability. His defense is supposed to be strong, but the badge is weak.      ","Never A More Roguelike Roguelike Shattered Pixel Dungeon, and it's similar mods, are the most fun, fair, well thought out/executed Roguelike games in mobile gaming right now. Brutally difficult, it still rewards good strategy and play choices. Absolutely punishing, it brings an immense feeling of satisfaction. It embodies the traditional RL genre by allowing players to learn through their mistakes, but without giving every vital piece of information. It's a mystery, that is more and more fun to unvelop. Play this game. Prepare to die      ","The cursed wand that makes everything youre wearing cursed There were some mechanics of the game that were changed or altered that I disagreed with, but accepted, but this is too much. It is unnecessary and needs to be removed completely. There is no point to this being a thing. Wearing cursed stuff was a pain but it was always a risk when equipping an item, but a wand that makes all your equipment cursed? The wizard class was already nerfed super hard and now it's pointless to play wizard entirely. Remove this from the game. People plz rate 1 star until they do.      ","One of the best rogue-likes I can sum this up as an addictive challenge. Five stars due to lack of bugs, the sheer fun I have playing it, and being completely free. No ads! You aren't required to buy anything to keep playing. There's no irritating stamina mechanic limiting your play time. You can play as often and as long as you like. Sometimes frustratingly difficult, you will feel compelled to either learn from your mistakes or to uninstall the game. For those who enjoy the challenge, a fully realized dungeon crawler awaits.      ","Really does well at that frustrating rouge-like feel Finally beat Shattered after about 100 runs and some frustratingly close calls. It's really a game that you play, rage quit over, later on remember how much fun it was, then rage quit again.      ",New updates are great! Thanks for updating the game frequently! Not all game Dev. can do that :) .      ,A fantastic game You like roguelikes? This is for you. Shattered is  in my opinion even better than the original PD now. And it just keeps on getting better.      ,"Absolutely a great game I've had hours of fun with this game, and it is by far my favorite roguelike so far. However, gnoll scouts are just a little too difficult to deal with in the beginning because I find myself low in health due to starvation. Playing the old warrior taught me to ration between floors, but that habit has not translated well to other classes in response to the warrior nerf.      ",Really appreciate playing it but what does the Blood Chalice really do??? Please tell what it does and if it does nothing DEV's please update. Also Huntress needs a bit better stats to be playable.      ,"Love it Easily the most replayable roguelike on all of Android. Only game I have kept on my phone longer than a week. Tight gameplay. Good wiki and explanations. Decently challenging. Good play-arc ie early, mid, lategame distinction. Best of all the pixeldungeons.      ","Mod of the original If the original is good, this will be greater.      ",Awesome! This is an amazing version of pixel dungeon! If you like rogue-like games than you can't let this one pass you by.      ,"I love it, but it needs more. It is a really nice mod of the game, but I think it would be better if you added a new area.      ",More food still starving to death in the later lvs but a year later im still entertained by this delightful game! Best game for free ever!      ,"Great game. Beat it on 89th run. Challenge time. Question regarding locked doors. Are there always keys on each floor to every door? I swear there have been a couple runs I've checked every possible wall looking for a door, possibly holding said key but to no avail. I just returned to a floor I was referring to and used a scroll of magic mapping. No doors missed and no key to the locked door. Glitch or what?      ",Rpg on steroids Good      ,Love it      ,Superb!      ,Boring Its boring      ,"Best modified pixel dungeon out there This one has the best graphics, no ads, awesome artifacts, I love it! Hoping some time in the near future you will add another class!      ","Good, but... Still my favorite version of Pixel Dungeon, but recent ""rebalancing"" has made it much less rewarding. Having unlocked the Tome of Mastery for every character felt like an accomplishment, and then you just take that away due to ""balancing issues""? And now I hardly even bother with the ghost because her rewards are NEVER worth it. Spear +1 on two subsequent runs? I see why she can't beat a single fetid rat. Edit: More often than not, Mimic loot is cursed and degraded. Wasteful.      ","So much harder than original Frustratingly addictive, only beat L5  1 out of about 15 so often want to throw phone at floor. Can i suggest that the phone vibrate when you are hit and life is very low? Dying because i forgot to look at health is not fun. The new font look great, nice and crisp maybe people don't like it because it is no longer '8 bit' text?      ",Awesome!!  ...and stupidly addicting.  Really challenges your creative and tactical thinking skills as you're forced to squeeze every iota of usefulness out of every item you have in your inventory...no matter how useless it appears.      ,"So much love The original pixel dungeon was fun as hell... the first hundred times. Development screeched to a halt on that one, and it almost seems to me like shattered is someone getting passed the torch. Constant fixes and tweaks throwing new wrenches in your runs, and the best part, I think, is how it has all stayed true to the realistic no-nonsense style of the original. This. Is. Perfect.      ",Best Pixel Dungeon Out There Hands down the best Pixel Dungeon out there. Really good balance of difficulty and constant updates makes this a solid way to kill a few minutes.      ,"Difficult but satisfying as heck! So what does this game provide from the original ""uncracked"" version? A slew of new mechanics, items and some major gameplay changes. Best part is, it works perfectly; the amazing original got an upgrade and it is simply glorious. Just adapt to the difficulty curve and start exploring.      ","Fun and addicting, tons of hours of dungeoneering! I love it, I love the challenge. It's a great way to sink tons of role-playing hours in. It's great, although a few performance bugs interrupts the floe of the game, this happened with my Oppo Mirror 5, random pauses with sharp popping sounds even on mute. I don't know if it's because of a custom Android OS, but if you can fix the bug, it'll be extremely helpful! Thanks for a great game!      ","The definitive pixel dungeon option Game is hard, really hard and to be honest I've been playing it for years and I still don't know how it all works, but it's a fanstastic, possibly the best rogue game out on android, I've not tried a ether one, well done Evan!      ","I like this game, a lot. This game Is great, it has such good replay value, and its so tough, I haven't beat it yet.  But I would really like to see new stuff, just, raw, new stuff. Items, trinkets, enemies, mabye even a new class. I love this game and I love how you all used to update this game a lot, please don't lose interest in this game. I love you all.      ","Entertaining, but difficult. A challenging game, easy to pick up and play, but almost impossible to beat if you're unlucky. With randomly generated floors, items, and enemies, this game is great to play when waiting in line.      ","Finally Well, I finally found the smartphone timewaster I was looking for. After *only* 2 years, I managed kill the boss and get back to the first level. However, while I know it's intentional, it's too much luck based. I love it when the game rewards me for being clever, and I feel down when a string of bad luck wastes a good character and I can't do anything to prevent it other than pray that some of the unidentified items may somehow save me. Keep up the good work!

Paid for the bag space pack and pet skin worth the money great prices to. this is NOT a pay to win game. But throw them the cash they deserve it big time      ,"Mindless but entertaining. The game is pretty straightforward. Each class/character has a few skills that you can level up, some more useful than others. Almost a dozen difficulty modes for when enemies get too easy. I did notice that purchasing things made it so ads disappeared... Until I upgraded phones. Now even if I restore the character via online, and hit ""restore purchase state"", it still throws ads at me randomly which can also randomly force close the game. Would like it if these things were fixed :/      ","Very Frustrated and Irritated. The character skills for a rogue are permanently stuck on two warrior skills with no way to change them. I loved this game, and now cannot stand it due to this error.  I was told that an upcoming version would fix my issue, but that was close to six months ago with No Change.

Character development is open,no fixed classes which I love. All information is presented fairly clearly. Decend the levels, kill loot,enjoy. With new game plus and permadeath option for replayability. my only con is a balancing issue, prepare to get one shotted by magic. A lot. Fear mages. Resist gear is near useless (with a bonus of 22 and 24 end the first mage duo I found instagibbed me) and makes dps or strafing utterly essential. Without exaggeration currently my fav app and one Im glad to have bought.      ","Horrible. Ridiculously difficult right from the start, even on the easiest difficulty setting. 1 minute into the game and the monsters kill you with one swipe. Seriously? Uninstalled and will never look at it again. A complete waste of even 99 cents!!      ","Oldskool Amiga/DOS style 1st person dungeon crawler! Awesome! What more can be said, the review title says it all.      ","Love the casual option! Awesome dungeon crawler so far ... and the casual play option, no risk of death, makes playing stressless and fun! 3 harder difficulty levels too for those who want a challenge :)      ",awesome game great game. wish there were more variety  of monster but still fun. hope there is a sequel! and hopefully you can import your character      ,"Great fun on the go! I really like the pacing of this game.  Not as intense or figity a full control fps style RPG, but not as slow as a turn based grinder.  Very well balanced, good challenge but not frustrating.      ",Exceeds expectations... Can't wait to see what's around the next corner! Great job!      ,"Great! Good gameplay, controls are well sized and easy to use on my galaxy s3. Could do with an indication of the cooldown time between attacks as timing them can be finnicky. Other than that it's a great way to kill some time when out and about.      ",Looking forward for new and full update. But i dont understand about earning skill points every level up? Is it randomly giving you a skill pts? Or  depends on the stats? Or every 3 or 5 lvl to earn skill pts?      ,"Awesome! This app/game is amazing, not. finished but amazing! Gotta grind, but if you are looking for an app you'll keep this is the one. Not for little kids. Ps (get bonemeal potions early).      ","Best rpg game ever (on android) No pop-ups, in-game purchases, ads, not even a request to rate it. Just plain good gaming.  I didn't think there were games like this on android.  Well thought out system, detailed quests, equipping and level ups. Loved it.  It's the real deal.      ","Awesome Keep it up... I can't wait to see this game progress! Some feedback, it would be nice if the attack menu were to be placed on the bottom; having it at the top makes a pain to reach on larger devices. ;)      ","Horrible Always miss attacks on very easy enemys, lose xp on death, 5hp health pots. What a joke.      ",Love it I spend all my free time playing this ever since I downloaded it. I love it.  The only sucky things is only getting to pick a perk every 3 lvls it should be like every 2 and having your XP go back to 0 when you lvl up. And pleeeaaasseee update with the finished map I need the rest of this game lol.      ,It ok Kinda boring and hard to play.you should make the game easy and we can choose the character we want then i will rate it five star      ,"Nice Free Game Since this is an open-source game provided for free, there are a few shortcomings, like no sounds, freely available assets used, etc. Nevertheless, for RPG fans, this one's worth checking out.      ","Still awesome This was a random download,  and is the only one I haven't uninstalled, impatiently wait for update      ","Ridiculous Grindfest You have to spend a ridiculous amount of time grinding to afford anything halfway decent, whether it be food or gear, not to mention how levels require like ten times more experience than was required for the previous level. Also, unless you put hit percentage in every level, be prepared not to hit anything ever. That said, I do like the story and the roguelike play, but the negatives just kill it for me. I know this is a work in progress, and I am looking forward to the updates. I give it a 2 for now.      ","An epic game by epic people This is by far one of the best indie rpgs on the market,  it's simple interface and intuitive game play make for an enjoyable experience.  While still in active development, there is plenty of content to keep you busy.  Great work, and can't wait for the next update.      ",In Love A very enjoyable RPG Dungeon Crawler! I sincerely cannot wait till more juicy updates come out! I havent been able to stop playing! Keep 'em comin boys!      ,Has great potential A few things are bothering me.. you stole sprites from Fire Emblem (I played long enough to see monk and shaman sprites) and the movement system is terrible. That's it. Besides that could be a great game.      ,"Got potential It's a bit too slow and unbalanced for my liking, but it has potential. Could use some form of sound, too. I'm not a fan of the percentage based experience point loss when killed. It's hard enough to level up, and fleeing doesn't always work.      ","Needs Work With awkward movement, confusing quests, low xp gain, high xp requirements per level, and easy deaths, I would not recommend      ","Top rpg list The best game iv played for long time. I wish someone can finish a few more maps dungeons and two citys nor and fey i love the game. Need to keep going but at a end. No ad's, no need to spend big cash to keep up. Just play and survive!!! UPDATE NOW PLZ      ","Awesome Is there ever going to be an update? If u would update game with missing maps and other, I would absolutely(!!!) be glad to pay for the ability to finish this awesome game; awesome in that the game has potential to be one of the great ones. Anyone else with me on this? Maybe if there's enough of us willing to support them, theyll bw able to finish game. 4/17/2016...still not updated for waaayyyy too long. Either update, finish or just take the game off googlplay....at this point its just teasing players.      ",Want it to get finished Awesome game love it. But I also like being able to go everywhere. I hate the fact that it has towns and parts of maps along roads that I cant go to and discover more quests. Im surprised by the age of the app that its not finished yet. I will gladly pay money for this app if I get a finished product and with over 500k downloads im sure it will be worth the programmers time. Awesome game though that you will keep on your phone      ,Yup that's what you think. Yeah it would have been a great day. I will not be able to take a look at this site for the first time. I'm sure it will be available for download.      ,Some small side quest updates please Hows about some quick side quests in some of the caves etc which are dotted around...fed up of waiting for new content. Get some user made maps and quests and get them out there asap!?      ,It's crap It's crap you can't make any money you drop exp every time you die and things at easy lvl can kill you fast if I could rate this a fat 0 I would biggest tip I can give is don't download this shyt      ,The game is very good... Game is good but it looks like updaters are dead... It is stupid that you stopped updating this game cause you didn't even finish it.There is 3 unfinished quests.      ,"Major pain to level up, but its fanfrikkintastic! It may be unfinished, but its good. The only problems I see are the stuttering effects produced when you press and hold in a direction to move. It may cause a stroke in people whom are sensitive to things like that. Also, are we supposed to update it ourselves? Since its open source, and hasn't been updated for 1 year and 8 months, it's like we players whom know how to program a game are supposed to update it ourselves. If it isn't the case, I kindly ask of you, the dev, to start developing it again.      ","Good, but some minor complaints I enjoy the game and how it plays, but the experience requirements leveling up, get really high after second level. Also, only earning a skill every four levels. I don't have a follow up to the skills every four levels, but it makes the choice of which to take that much more difficult.      ",Great game but I don't think the monsters should have the accuracy of a professional sniper hitting wings off a fly they should at least even it out and make it level based and even then you level up so slow I dont think it would matter but like the game but come on man I'm a rpg gamer nd honestly this has the base of a fantastic game but it needs a little more work      ,I used to like this game. I used to like this game but it hasnt seen any updates in over a year which sucks. I wish that it would see more map updates to be able to access maps that we currently cant right now.      ,"Great game Yeah, you gotta grind, and pay attention to stats, but that's the fun part, its not supposed to be so easy as to finish in your sleep. Great game to get involved in, lots of quests, loot, stuff to kill. Great game. Amazing its free to play. Almost made me cry.      ",This is like the Skyrim of Mobile Games Loving the game so much it makes it hard for me to sleep early at night. Just like now. Lol. Hope that anyone who reads this downloads the game. It is so worth the time!      ,"Brilliant game, just needs a few tweaks. Downloaded on a whim, played it every chance I get! Would be 5 stars except it just needs a few tweaks. For example, I have a hitrate of 100% and I still mids sometimes. Also, if the exp level bars didn't double/triple every time you levelled up, it would be easier to progress.      ",Hate it I used to love the game but when you get killed you loose a  bunch of experience like is its a pain to even level up  and then. You get killed and loose 700exp  after how hard it is to gain all that experience      ,Great game slow development Its been over a year and a half I haven't played in months cuz I'm bored n theres nothing else I can do. You havent even had a project meeting since last decembe! If you  dont care about the game hen juat remove the damned thing from android or UPDATE PLEASE!!!!! You are WAY too slow at updating. Not everything has to be fixed/finished for your next update but give us something to do!!! Update it more and you'll get 5 stars!      ,It has potential I gave it a 3 even though the movement square by square annoys me enough for a 1. This game has a lot of potential just like many others that are similar emerging like this. But when your trying to get somewhere fast over and over again the one square movement drives you nuts and interest in the game drops. Then the uninstall. Also i don't have time to register in a forum every time I have an improvement idea. I'll leave this on my desktop for a lil while in hope some corrections for smoother performance is      ,"Stupid. Had loads of potential, was lots of fun starting off until I started realizing the hit % are bullshit. Snakes at 110% hit chance will ALWAYS hit you where I have 115% chance can't seem to hit a freaking thing with no status effects. That makes this game stupid and unplayable. You can't get anywhere if you can't kill anything.      ","Great game. That jarod guy must be new to RPGs, just because you have 110% attack chance doesn't mean you will always hit your enemy, you have to consider their block chance.  You can see any enemy's stats by tapping on their picture under the attack button. There are enemies you can barely get through a fight with as a low level player that won't be able to damage you any at all later on.  Things may seem high priced early on but a little later money won't be an issue and you will have more than you need.      ","Fun game I really enjoy this game. They have a platform that works great so I just wish they spent more time on new content. Grinding gets old after awhile. Quest are what make this game go by, oh and cool gear.      ","Could use improvement This is actually my first time playing a classic style rpg and it is an unforgettable experience. I downloaded this three times before i actually decided to give it a try. The only things to make this game better than it already is is to add some music and touch tones, it gets kind of dead without some good music. Also, when is the maps all gonna be input? Or do you just have to complete certain tasks to get farther on like across the river west of loneford. I defeated the river troll. Overall,good game.      ",I'd be willing to give it five stars If the game wasn't made of dead ends where one would actually be able to go early in the game....instead most areas actually available to be explored are  high level areas...which makes it really boring to level up....oooo let's kill that group of low level creatures 5000 times to get enough gold to buy enough potions to maybe explore and oh....another unfinished area where I can't continue....guess I'll go back to those little guys for another week since nothing else is any good for gold...      ,Nice game Way to much grinding to level up also skill points sud be every 2/3 levels not every 4. Apart from that I really enjoyed playing the game plz finish it asap      ,"Brilliant but dead development? Amazing game that I've sunk hundreds of hours into, but the last update was over 18 months ago, and as it stands, the game is not finished. Has development stalled completely? This is worth getting for the fun, but don't expect to be able to complete it yet... or maybe ever.      ",Great Fun Game! The game is not completely finished but is a blast to play! I am eagerly awaiting the next segment! Thanks for hours of fun! Keep up the good work!      ,Wish that the pvp fights during maps were removed. I wind up fighting the same five or six people all the time. If I wanted to fight pvp I would go into the tower or tavern and challenge them.      ,Good but just one problem i found thus far Pvp seems tacked on like an afterthought also i relly hate being forced to fight another player but the current system sets them right in the road so you cant dodge them please fix or at least a disable option of some sort well should count my blessings at lest i dont have to deal with trashtalk      ,Confusing at first but get used to it I admit at first the game was pretty confusing but after a bit you'll understand every concept of the game      ,"Combat I wish the combat was a little more than just waiting. It seems like there is no real tactics to the game. Rather, having a monster with a high attack wins you the game.      ","Great game but way under developed Good game however game constantly glitches to a point that you can't press the start battle button which results in having to close the game and start over, wastes energy, coins, and your time.      ","Fun It's fun finding a simple game, that's fun and yet time consuming. Here's hoping it continues to impress.      ","Awesome, but a few problems Devs need to pay more attention to the game. A great game is where the devs actually listen to the players that are paying them. My big issue at the moment is the cost and availability of coins. Gems are pretty fairly priced. But coins are outrageous! I have seven EP creatures that are ready to be evolved into Legendary, but the cost is one million coins each! Not only is that a bit ridiculous, but $100.00 in real money only gets you 600,000 coins. And gaining coins in the game is too slow. 5 stars if fixed      ","P2p and ofc p2w, Just another copy scam. Hard to evolve with artifacts(chances of getting uc or above artifacts are very very low) because they even made artifact packs cool scam lol. There are better games don't bother installing, 90% card games in the market are just trash. This type of games are garbage, nobody should ever play them and rate them 1 star if you mistakenly ever played. Not in 2016 su*kers.      ",Lost purchase I bought gems and while it was processing it crashed I got charged but did not get gems I contacted them about it and they have not responded its been three days      ,Glitch I am A level 54 and it will still not let me use my 5th slot for a creature. Everytime I try it resets it from the server.      ,OK seems it will be fun A couple things are a little not so great about it ..but nothing to make the game bad so far it's fun to play I would recommend playing it if you're into these kinds of games and looting      ,Loved it I loved this game all the features. However few things can be added like the skills of the creature which I can use manually      ,"Pretty good This is a great game. The mechanics are nice and the system is stable. However there is one problem, the character slots are reset once you close the game. Even though I am level 20 i cannot change the monsters in my 3rd and 4th slots. I can only change the monsters in the first 2 slots which are unlocked at the beginning  of the game. Please fix this, this really could be a five star game.      ","It's ok... Difficult to understand at first.  Especially if your phone dumps during the tutorial.  I haven't found a help section yet.   Edit: Really don't like the integrated PvP in the quests.  I generally don't go after peeps that are unbeatable, yet the PvP forces me to.      ",Cool Cool.  Fun.  Cool      ,Some of the levels are screwed up Some of the levels like fairy forest level 2 are broken because a blockade thing is blocking me on either side so I can't do anything. If someone knows how to fix this tell me. P.s. I'm not asking people to call me stupid it's the easiest thing in the world only advise.      ,Kinda Cool Game started out cool but I've reached the ever dreaded stale mate.  Repetitive BS      ,"Good game, hard to figure out how inventory works, came in 3rd in pop session, but couldn't find what I won!      ","Different kind of RPG Not too bad, really. Doesn't beat you to death asking you to buy stuff.      ",Interesting Got boring since you can only evolve creatures so far and the only way to get better ones was to pay      ,"I like it, but... Great game but I've just gotten to the 4th or 5th level and it's too hard to win. Seems a but ridiculous to step up the difficulty so quickly.      ","If you haven't played, DON'T DOWNLOAD Only good thing is its fast automated gameplay. Luck-based gameplay sucks, PvP SUCKS, grinding sucks, items and coins quickly becoming obsolete sucks, Legendary creatures being next-to-impossible to get SUCKS. The game teased a lot of things but actually offers almost nothing. If you haven't touched the game, DO. NOT. START.      ","Only been playing for 10 mins, but it brings to mind some RPG's from back in the day. So far, so good.      ",Dungeon equilibrium Bought two times to get six hundred jewels but they took my money but never gave me my jewels I would have put a higher star rating if they would give the jewels.      ,Ok Can't play anymore. Loading screen never ends whenever I try to go home to do upgrades. Broken game.      ,Amazing but I dont like having to use wifi all time. Pleasssse add offline mode      ,Great Great game for lonely evenings or boring lectures        ,So far so good Might make it 5 stars if it holds my interest a while longer      ,Slow & confusing Hard to understand what you are supposed to do and there are way too many loading screens. Not fun.      ,Very fun! I've played a variety of rpg games (blood brothers etc...) but eventually I stopped playing because I got bored. But this game is different. The art style is so unique and the combat is fun. It's awesome.      ,Referral code is 3c52a3a8. Add for bonus stuff! Decent game. Like that I can play it without using the internet.      ,The Game I like the game. It's really fun and addicting. Good job!      ,Fun game I like that while advancing through the floors each step you take is a surprise.      ,Great! Little crazy at first! Once you get a hold of things it's a great way to kill time      ,Love the theam After some initial instability the game has smoothed out and is running fine now      ,Good but Items for items for upgrades be like. You need luck? Haah lel.      ,"Solid so far Interesting play style, I've been looking for a new quality game      ",Gd concept Good game so far turn based gd not lag issues or anything      ,"Good game, fun to play. Not playing long but for now is fun      ",love this game. I would play all day if I had the energy!      ,"Extremely poor performance Since the newest updated that was pushed recently, it's now running at a complete slideshow. In combat it's running at 2-3 fps on an LG G4. I love this game, the mechanics, even the mechanics, but the game is completely unplayable on a snapdragon 808 equipped phone, which is powerful enough to play the latest games, 3D or otherwise. Until this is fixed, I am uninstalling the game and rating 1 star.      ","Awesome Pause menu would be beneficial, but I'm not complaining. What's that online alpha function about? Actual multi-player or just leaderboards?      ","Some fixes still needed 1) There is no way to pause, the app and its music always runs in the background 2) I think adding multiple character slots would greatly improve the experience 3) cannot access overworld map 4) Boss achievements don't work 5) lags horrendously on my Moto X-Play when attacking, maybe add an option to turn off damage numbers? otherwise quite fun.      ","An interesting sequel I did not expect to see the sequel to one of my favourite childhood Flash games end up as a full on Legend of Zelda homage. Credit for such an interesting and fresh sequel. It does feel a bit too easy, something I believe has been fixed with the update. There is no way to pause this App either, the music will continue. Traversing the overworld can be tedious but it's all a part of the quest. So, 4/5      ",When I try to get in the game the screen goes black      ,"Still no lag fix See above, emailed dev and they only said, ""that's weird."". Ummmm can you fix instead of just stating it is weird?      ",Not for me It all seems to work ok but was rather repetitive. Not my kind of thing.      ,Just a small problem Despite Google play saying it is in version 2.5 when I download it I get version 2.2 which could be fine except for the fact it keeps crashing. It crashes randomly and is on a Bush 4 (obscure android phone) EDIT: still not sorted AVOID      ,"I've put off buying this for so long... Honestly a really fun game. My only issue I have is the controls, but that is me, I'm not a big fan of tap/click to move controls. Over all, super fun and love how you're just tossed into this world and must figure it out on your own. Love it.      ","F'n Awesome! Needs more content & polish! To start, landscape orientation without screen rotation enabled. Can't wait for III! Love it! An overall improvement of the first... Though I read it's too short..which I wouldn't know, because I'm grinding like there's no tomorrow. Needs instructions, if not just a basic outline of controls & stats. The campfire restores health, but does it save your location and stats/gear. Tap repeatedly to spam attacks. Heart grants extra life. Coin transfers after death. No official exit or save progress button. Wish it had some sort of stash, to save equipment permanently, regardless of death.      ","Back to 1 star for Special Boss Glitch I had to make this 1 star again because although the boss glitch that freezes the game is fixed, the special boss you can choose to fight at the end (the whole heart tombstone and purple guy with red sword boss) is glitched. Although he does not attack or move, he is invincible. He'll take damage, but it doesn't do anything to his health. Made a one star so this would be noticed.      ",Love it well worth the small purchase Thanks you for fixing the boss freeze bug it works perfectly now I've just beat the game and restarted over having beaten many bosses and worked perfectly. There is a small amount of lag with stealth enemies ghosts and such but that's it. 5/5 and again thanks for the fix! EDIT: once your dexterity gets high enough that you crit 100% or more lifesteal no longer works and I assume it's the same with other stats lifesteal is essential but does not proc on crits so it never procs once you get high enough level      ,"Pretty good but poor controls Has some great elements but the tap to move controls completely kills it and makes it frustrating to play. Targeting enemies also feels a bit clunky and frustrating. Music, art, and the general idea for the game are great. Can be a bit repetitive after a few deaths constantly starting from scratch, wish you kept more than just the money. Maybe stats or skills or getting some sort of special item or bonus depending on how far you get. Layout and dungeons are not randomized either which adds to repetitiveness      ","I tried very hard to like this game. Combat is fun, random equipment and leveling up is fun. Game world is nice. Dungeons are well made. But the game has a glaring flaw. No way to pause the game. Even if you hit the home button to minimize the app it continues to run in the background. Enemies can continue to chew on your character, etc. Hitting the back button in game doesn't do anything. Only way to close it for sure is to also remove it from the recent apps list. Annoying.      ","Awsome, sort of? Different every time! Or so it seems. there aren't really many differences every time you play. And after you beat it. It turns into weapon and armour collection. Also every enemy needs buffing because they are way to weak. And make the bosses unflinching because THEY die if you constantly click on them. But it's still fun though!      ","Awesome * control is too loose. Must say I'd prefer this to have better ability to face enemies.  Perhaps press and flick to change stationary facing direction?

My brother and i have loved this game since it came out a year or two ago but have always been intrigued by the idea of multiplayer. Just wondering if there was a time frame on it      ,10\10 It was worth the every penny can't wait to so your new games.      ,"Nice game I feel like for such a short game a bonus would be hard achievements to earn to help maybe sometime in the future. My main reason for posting this is because of all the one stars I saw about bosses. Bosses are fine with newest version so please, don't overlook a great roguelike because people can't be bothered. All in all its awesome      ","Cool. This game is always different between levels and the monsters within each level, although minor setback is if you have a blutooth keyboard it wont move the character (W,A,S, and D keys) every other button works. Hope youll fix and continue updates.      ","After playing, Delver immidiatly became my favourite game on my tablet. The touch controls really brought down the game though, so I plugged in my blue tooth keyboard (although the review below said it doesnt work, either the Dev fixed it, or just the type of keyboard) and I used the keyboard to move, pick up stuff, and attack, and used my other thumb on screen to look and manage my inventory, and the game really shined. I love the atmosphere, and pretty much everything about the game. But when you get to the cave levels, they are a little too open and with the beholders it gets really cheap and overly difficult. After watching PC gameplay this issue seems fixed, and Im hoping eventually it will be on here too.      ","Looks good, pretty challenging. The graphics are nice and nostalgic, and I dig the music. I really dislike the controls. Ranged combat is tough because it can be hard to aim at an opponent far away. Melee can be tough because the attack button is in a weird spot. I kind of wish for turn-based combat. Enemy casters and the beholder guys ruin every game for me. Hope for a resistance potion, or you're starting over. Hopefully I'll find the right stat balance to get me through those fights.      ","Great I love the game I would by any from the developer like this the problem is on tablets and phones the controls and monsters coming at you to fast to beat them cause the controls are akward to use on a phone or tablet this games perfect for pc but I only use a phone now, and play mostly on android there must be some way to even the playing field against the enemy's on phone maybe making it possible to sneak up on them idk      ","I really love this game but... It needs some love. The developer hasn't updated it for over a year which would have been fine if it was a free beta however there is a price attached to it. I have searched for information and found nothing. The Steam version appears to be the favored son, recieving regular content and bug fixes. I would easily give the game 5 stars if I could get a straight answer on when and if an update is coming to the phone version or if it has been abandoned altogether.      ","Won't install. Freezes after getting to 100% of download package. Will not install and because I tried again after refunding and rebooting my Galaxy S2 and got the same result, now the Play store wont give me the refund option.      ","A very fun rougelike RPG I'm impressed to see how far this game has come now. The graphics look so much better, there is RPG choices to make when leveling, the UI got better (thanks for letting us know what potions do what now), and so much more. It's a really good game now and I can't wait to see what comes in future updates.      ",Needs something Really great game but please add box breaking that will make the game a lot better please add! I will give 5 stars if you do! :)      ,"Movement issues Would be a five star for sure but my character gets locked in starring positions which results in killing me all the time, also if arial combat was a little simplar, the flying squids are almost impossible to kill      ","Very nice but outdated. This game is very much fun, and I love the artstyle. But buyers beware, this is not the same as the steam version. The mobile version is almost a year old with no updates since.      ","Great game, but... I love this game but they haven't updated it in over a year and a half now. The PC version on the other hand, is updated quite often. This game has been abandoned by it's developers. If you're buying this game and updates are a must have, then you may want to reconsider buying this game. If not, it's still quite fun even though the PC version has more content.      ","One of the best dungeon crawlers out there! Im liking the whole randomly generated world idea. The permadeath can be a little slow, but overall a great game. Would be great if we saw this game become moga enhanced!      ","Oh god my life This game is by far the greatest game on mobile devices. I don't care if you've never played a dungeon crawler, or a first person game, this is amazing. It puts the difficulty of dark souls, the beauty of 8 bit original game graphics, and the classic architecture of a dungeon crawler, this is the ace in the hole      ","The Big 4 Minecraft, Minicraft, Legends of Yore and DELVER! All must haves.   UPDATE: Holy cow, this game keeps getting better! Insane replay value, a simple modern nethack c: really love the graphics!      ","Awsome Great game but how about getting rid of those hearts and putting an actual numer for hp plus how about a status sheet to gauge when im leveling up next or want to see how my charecters states are. Other than that great game and challenging, I keep dying but oh well, ill make it sooner or later :)      ",Great dungeon crawler If you're into dungeon games this is an absolute must have. Only downside is that I'm having a problem using attack button on my moga using keyboard emulation. Cant use the pivot app because the HID setup is wrong for it.      ,Fix the gamepad issue You have native gamepad for PC? Why not implement it for this  Port it's to long over due since the games been out so long and not hard to include...please fix it      ,"Great It's a great game, however, I really hope the newer features of the PC version eventually make it over to Android, like the breakable crates and the chunkier cave structures. Additionally, an option to use the Android ""immersive mode"" would be nice. I'd gladly donate if such improvements are ever implemented, and hopefully I wouldn't be the only one. I bought this game twice, once on Steam and once here, and since I no longer have a PC I'm hoping the Android version hasn't been abandoned.      ",Tilt controls maybe? I have a crappy single touch device.. might be playable with responsive tilt controlled look/turnand assignable function keys. More options would be nice like auto face attacker- anything to ease the chaos seeing as how this is 'fp' but not a 'fps'.anyway to hasten the loading at start?      ,I keep coming back (to life) for more! It's funny how a few simple game elements can just click to make a great gaming experience. Deliver is that kind of game. Rogue-like dungeon crawlers can't get better and simpler! I got to floor 8 and got blasted to smithereens by a new enemy... But I'm not even mad! Let's restart and get payback!      ,A great game. I was skeptical at first but decided to go ahead and try it. Best purchase I ever made. Its a very good dungeon crawler with lots of randomization and a strange addiction setting to it. Awesome. Runs smooth on Moto G 2nd.      ,"Best Game on Android I play Delver all the time, it's great to play for fifteen seconds or an hour. Controls well, looks great, and is an absolute blast! Keep it up, the constant addition of new stuff keeps me coming back for more and more.  One thing: MOGA pivot support would be a dream come true      ",PC port that needs some fixes Add support for game pads. Shield owners I would pass until issues are fixed. There is a horrid issue with the inventory pointer showing up and then you are done for. At this point pretty much a waste of money. Fix this and I will gladly update this review.      ,You did it.  :) Single best rogue like on the market.  Replayability: endless randomization of dungeons: awesome.  Graphics pixel licious perfection.  Liquid smooth  implementation.   Music .  Beautiful. .. white Wolf?? Right? :)    followed this from the beginning.   When you updated to the pc version it became Pinnacle of any Android rogue ever made.    It's amazing.   Thank you.  You have a Hardcore fan here.  Priority interrupt.  Any chance down the road you will update boarding party in the future???      ,"Love the game, but having issue on my new s5 I really like this game, and used to play it on my Droid1, 2 & 4. I recently switched to a Galaxy S5, and the game seems to have an issue where I am always moving backwards, making it somewhat unplayable.  Hopefully this gets sorted out soon.  Thanks for the continuing updates!      ","I like the game.  It's fun and challenging and fresh every time.  I used to play the PC version back when that was free (a few years ago or so).  I intend to get the PC version again on Steam and be able to play there.  As for the Android version, controls are a little difficult.  Attacking can be difficult when the button to attack is hit in the same area as looking around.  Would be nice to just tap the screen to use a selected item/weapon.  No GUI, just any tap on the right side attacks.  This would make it easier to manage battles.  Also, will there be Moga or any HID support for the game in the future?      ","Awesome The only thing is that the controls are so hard to use. The attack button is so freaking small, awesome game but controls are bad. Also it would be cool for like a continue our something because of you die you don't have to start from scratch again. But this game has a good concept.      ",Make online This game is really fun I just beat it and it is still really fun looking forward to new updates. Would be really fun online. Recently tho I have experenced laggs and errors on the file I beat the game on. Please fix and u will get 5 stars      ,"10/10 IGN This is an awesome game with rogue like aspects like when you die it's permanent and you restart. The goal is to get to the bottom kill the necromancer then bring the orb back up to the surface. Sounds easy right? Right? Wrong. It only takes one step to screw yourself over. Either step on a pressure plate, drink a bad potion, run into traps, ect. I think this game is awesome and I strongly Recommend it to any fans of the genre.      ",Great Dungeons Adventures Thanks to the yogcast I found this game. It just simple RPG dungeon fun. Its simple to play but challenging at the same time. Thank you for a lovely game      ,BRAVO its great to see an update that hasnt ruined an app. this is probably the best dungeon crawler game ive played. anyone reading this should just stop reading and dowload this game already. However the game has crashed on me twice and corrupted my save. Both times I had over 300 coins      ,"Amazing I love the game, and play it any chance I get. I've played more than a few hours worth over the last couple of weeks, and I love every bit of it, except for one error in the dungeon gen. I've noticed that a teleport trap sometimes gets placed in a one way hallway, and it teleports you back to a place you've already been, forcing you to restart and delete the world. Once this little thing is fixed, I can safely say this is the best game on android.      ",Hopefully it gets updated eventually Like the new features in the update but unfortunately the game can get so choppy at times it's unplayable.  I understand it's still in development so I'll wait and hope it gets better.      ,"Coooool Love this game more than most on the  google play store, but there is a rather big glitch I encountered. I bought a jeweled sward of speed from the merchant at the encampment, and it would not hit any enemies. All other weapons would, but not my 200 gold piece jeweled sword!                                                               Edit: Using a Bluetooth keyboard doesn't allow me to attack. Every other button works, but attacking doesn't work on any key.      ","Great potential! I understand this game is still under development .That said, for what this game already is, I'm impressed. The developers are taking this game in the right direction. KEEP IT UP AND KEEP UPDATING :D  To buyers: Obviously this game isn't a final product and needs refining, so be wary when purchasing this app. Limited content!  To dev: Would like to see a more variety of enemies, weapons, and armors. Also expand on the magic dynamics as the ""magic wands"" are essentially a ranged weapon and nothing more.      ","Good game, but gets kinda repetitive after a while The controls are as good as you can get on a touch screen. It's a fun game but after a while the simplicity of it makes the whole experience somewhat repetitive. But I recommend it nevertheless!      ","I freaking love this game An amazing roguelike that I've enjoyed since its initial release on android. I've beaten it many times and still never get bored, and the continued updates make it even better. I would like a little more variety on the bottom levels though,  especially since the 7th floor is exactly the same every time.      ","Good stuff... PLEASE ADD MOGA CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! I would really like to double tap to auto-attack an enemy for melee and an aim assist for wands. This would REALLY help with playability. I can't hit anything with wands.... a tiny dot reticule would be welcome. Update: the wands have a crosshair, but only when firing... Which defeats the point. Please fix and have constant crosshairs!      ","Great Bought this one on Steam, as soon as I found out this have Android version I think no further. Instant purchase!  Why no iOS version tho? I'll buy it for my iPhone as well.  Oh also would be great if we can sync saves between devices probably using Facebook or Google or something.      ",Fun to pass the time For the money this game is great.  I own it for both my mobile and pc.  It's not cutting edge or ground breaking but if you are a first person RPG fan it will keep you entertained.  The music is good but loops too much(not a lot of variety).  The graphics suite the game well.  Caststers make the game diffcult and probably have a few balancing issues to be worked out.      ,Awesome! Great fast work devs!      ,Awesome game Love it.      ,Nvida shield controls don't work      ,"Good There is a bug on nvidia shield, every time I walk downwards it opens up my skill point a little annoying but other than that good game!      ",Great game great customer service      ,Looping Dungeon Repetitive. In twenty minutes you'll see every thing this game has to offer. The enemies and bosses repeat every four levels. The dungeon's main layout never changes and leaves no room for any exploration. Not worth the time or money.      ,"Glorious It's dangerous to go alone! Do it anyway! Fantastic creation of nostalgia, difficulty, and playability. I have only one complaint: when picking up items, the text is often underneath my thumb. Annoying, but not critical.      ","Zelda's dungeon crawling + arcade + roguelike Fun, fast, frustrating. First it lulls you into thinking that it's way too easy. Then you die from a silly mistake and are taken aback a little. Bite your tongue. Then you die again. Ok let's get serious aaaand you're hooked. Only thing I feel is missing is a scoreboard of some kind.      ",Amazing game Love the concept of the game. I can keep playing it forever even though it is repetitive. Leveling up and getting equipment to defeat the soul eater to get your wife back is an awesome aim for the game and the gameplay wil make me come back for more!!!!!      ,"GOD THIS IS AWESOME plz add an option at the end of the game (if there is an end) to keep on continuing endlessly becuz i love this game for its awesome loot and give me a sense of progress and if it ends then playing will have no point as i will have to start all over, and i dont like that..... please create and endless mode to continute for ever to my heart's content this is the one of the only games that makes me happy plz........please       ","I've spent a LOT of time playing this game and having fun but there gets to be a point where I want some kind of quest or at least a goal,  not just endless grinding.      ","    A MATAEUS REVIEW      The animations are nice. The music is nice. But that's pretty much it! It's just a clicker, and I didn't expect that. You drag treasure chest items into your inventory, and tap as fast as you can on monsters to despatch them. No quests, no sense of reward or progression; heck, there aren't even any instructions. It's just plain old boring, simple as that. Don't be fooled by the screenshots, as I was, into thinking this is a Zelda clone. It most definitely is not.      ","No substance Good graphics and interface but let down by the total lack of story, engagement, feeling of progression or basically anything. All you ate required to do is mash the screen and that's it. Badly needs a story, interactions or something to hold my interest. Look at the Banner Saga for an epic game.      ","Fun little dungeon crawler I like this trend where Indie game devs are releasing their PC games on iOS and Android as well.  This one's been in my Steam Wishlist for awhile, but now I can play it on the go.  Great little C2M (click-to-move) hack n slash rogue dungeon crawler.  If you've never played Zelda before (...seriously?), this game was obviously influenced by it, and will appeal to fans of Zelda, Binding Of Isaac, etc.  Grab this one, beat it, then get the sequel!      ","Fun and addicting This game rocks.  Brings me back to the old days of playing Zelda on NES and SNES, and playing nethack on my Linux box.      ",Classic! Addicting! Good old fashioned hack and slash. Like how the game auto saves after dungeon completion. Once I figured out the drag and drop chest system my frustration gave way to elation!      ,Fun but Glitchy Developer has fixed all the glitches. Very fun to play and find new items.      ,"Great game I really enjoy this game, but I recommend that the developer add a separate multiplayer mode that is double the difficulty that you can clear with your friends      ","Utter waste of money There are no instructions. There's a chest i can move, a potion i can drink, and door that doesn't open. WTF?!      ",Great game. Just needs more variation. But I believe that comes in bit Dungeon II.      ,My gammmmmeeee I haven't gotten past level 4 but I love it      ,A little bummed Not quite what I was hoping it would be. It's pretty repetitive.      ,Laggy I played this on my last phone and it was fine but on my droid maxx 2 it is so laggy I cannot play it please fix      ,Best ios game I've ever seen      ,"Great game needs custom controller option Gpd xd, jxd s5800, and shield tab plus ps3 controller.  None work with the game. Most shield portable titles work fine.  Please add an options menu to enable gamepad support manually and if possible a custom control assignment.  Love this game though.      ",Super! Ekstremt simpelt og bliver af uforklarlige grunde ved med at v re sjovt x)      ,"I played this before on my iPod._. When I saw it available for my device I said ""awe f*ck yeah!"". :3 buying this up.      ",Awesome! I'm having a great time playing the game!      ,Awesome Provides hours of fun.      ,"Too Easy Well done and fun at first, but it devolves into a simplistic grind fairly quickly.      ",Love it I really enjoy this game a lot      ,Repetitive but damn fun      ,Lame      ,"worth the 2$ needs these things though. personal leaderboard too like like to bost alls it needs now is settings, classes, more music, maybe a pinch option(maybe not),so on the phone when i try to look at loot it needs 2b when i press on it moves up like 3 or 4cm so i can read whats in it. thats all cool game, maybe a difficulty setting too. also the enemy's can you make them swarm on me please i want to feel like they really are trying to kill me lets face it im going to terminate them with extreme prejudice it would be nice to feel like they are too. bosses maybe or could be harder.      ",Crap buggy Keep getting pushed out of rooms and frozen into empty rooms during boss fights. I have restarted the same level 3 times now...enough of this.  Delete.      ,Awesome Loved it since it came out!      ,Great game Best game      ,Zelda Clone = GREAT TIME! Love this game.  Super simple to play and incredibly addictive!  Totally reminds me of playing all of the dungeons in the first Legend of Zelda (which I played over and over again numerous times).  I highly recommend it!  And it plays great on NVIDIA SHIELD!      ,Great game but... -1 star: Pressing d pad down or the left thumbstick down shows stats.  Like pressing y.  Why?   -2 Stars: And why must I force close just to exit the game...      ,Great game Often exits a room immediately upon entering other than that great game.      ,"Won't open!!! Look, I love this app, and have played about 40-50 hours on it, but the last week or so it won't open no matter what I try, it just opens with a black screen and then crashes!! I don't want to lose my data!! I will update with 5 stars if someone can help me!! Because I do really think its a great game! Well worth the 99c when it works!      ","Fun and addictive It's really fun but when I got to seacean I caught him and forgot to save so I went back to go capture him again, he ran away and he won't respawn.Same with Blix      ","LOW RANKING CREO Unless you want to BUY creo from the store, you're going to be spending most of this game looking at pretty crappy creo summons. Which is funny since the game requires you to buy it to play. If we have to BUY the game (which i honestly prefer over free to play IAP) we should be able to find rare and powerful creatures for free. But anything 4 stars or higher either runs, or resists the link capture no matter what unless you have a dominous, and it'll be a cold day in hell before you even find one 3 star +      ",Awesome.......just awesome! I really love this game. I see this game getting better and better. Keep up the great work.      ,"Kinda Weird Ininstalled this app, and it was awesome. Then I got to this place and a weird future guy appeared and he said we met again, i dont know if you did any changes, but it got me all messed up. Still, I have been enjoying this game since I bought it. Awesome, and worth it game,      ","Ok As much as I enjoy the game, it has some common spelling errors in the dialog. Not only this, but having healing moves for every creo kind of ruins the fun. People can heal all the time, making battles last forever!      ","Best Android game PKM inspired Great art in general, great characters and creos art, neat battle system, great variety of scenarios, fair prices for the complete game and DLC. Although, the OST is very limited and repetitive, lack of guides (the wiki is incomplete) and some paid itens not being available for you to acquire through game play take some points. Even though, 5*.      ","What's new? Hi, is there something new in this game? I get bored when play this time. There's no one can beat me now.      ","Amazing Game! EvoCreo is an awesome game. It has a fun story and is quite challenging. EvoCreo may be like Pok mon, but it is very unique at the same time. I've already recommended this game to several people. If you're a Pok mon fan, you should definitely give this game a try.      ",Help I'm stuck in the forest trying to get to hydro city but I can't find how to get there is there some sort of bug?

When I go online to battle people it only lets me battle for like 5 seconds and then mess up.I would put more stars if this wasn't an issue.      ,I can't pick up the prime gems the little red ruby thing what's wrong      ,I love it This is an amazing game its worth 99 cents other games that are inspired by Pok mon have to do with energy bars which is annoying but this one is different its challenging and fun and I just love it and if you guys made a squeal I would be so happy :)      ,"Worth paying 79p This game is great fun and brings a unique battle system, no more 5x flamethrower in a row.  It's Challenging, especially trying to catch creos as if they are 6*+ they have a habit of running after 1 link attempt (tip: put them to sleep) I have experienced 1 problem though, when I'm in a menu and press the back key (on my phone - not the app) a few times it sometimes goes to a black screen and I have to force close and re-open the app, loosing everything since the last auto save. Tho It isn't game breaking.      ",Help!!! After making an undesired purchase in store and returning to the main menu (without saving) I'm finding myself continuously ripped off by not getting my Gemma back even with autosave off. This is very very very annoying as the only way past it is starting an entirely new game which I've done more than 5 times now. I don't think the developers want the game to inconvenience their customers so much that they want them to start a new game for every episode of wasted gemma. Please fix.      ,"At least you tried It's cool until you realize your attacks barely hit 50% of the time without a status affect; your status affects don't affect the enemy at all; the get to use their moves more often; and just wait until they start healing themselves! Man are you in for a 45 minute treat that you probably won't win because they heal themselves every other turn. But, the creo are definitely not lacking, and the gameplay is great. A little buggy at times (d pad has a mind of its own sometimes and the creo sometimes disappear)      ",Horrible The game is a joke I sat for two hours with a level 99 creo against a level 60 the thing was unbeatable due to the fact 8/10 of my moves missed or didn't flinch it once..ended up have to forfeit and lost 19k money disgusting it's not the only one every fight I do 8/10 moves miss I paid for the game and do enjoy it sometimes until I have to fight as I know my moves will miss if use fix this def five star until then I wouldn't even recommend this game to my friends      ,"Simple Small bug, response needed* I beat the game and got both expansions, beat the first one (shadow hive) and now I'm on the alphite expansion.

Just a small bug here, send me an email back please I'd you can fix this, I'm sure it's not that bad but I really want to see what happens next I'm absolutely loving this story.      ","Great game Wonderful and well thought out story,  reminds you just enough of your childhood to pull you in but it puts a spin on it and offers some great improvements as well.   My only complaint would be in the evolutions.  I find them to be silly at times and sort of cut and dry.  I say this because you'll see that many resemble the same concept as evee in the pokemon games. Add more creo and make it less evee like and 5 stars from me easy.  Definitely worth the money.      ","Great Monster Hunter I have tried my fair share of monster hunter games. This one is the best. Worth every penny. Great game play, great monsters and tons to explore and do! Keep it up! Can't wait for more updates, and sequels! Every update just has more fun monsters to find, and reveals more story!      ","Online trolls When I first go to battle online, people disconnected 3 seconds after the battle starts. I first thought this was just a small issue about connection and unfair creo's. Then it got frustrating, I met the same guy all day and he have a volcadon, A VOLCADON while I only have 1 Singlish. And what did he do? Disconnect on purpose evrytime. Can you guys do something? Add like a anti troll delay or something like a penalty? I'm getting sick of trolls. But overall the game is pretty good ;)      ","I LOVE THIS GAME! Soo simulator to pokemon and I love pokemon (but not the show only the very first series was good now meowth sounds like a gangster and team rocket is smart) getting full version love dis game. Play this game if you love Pokemon battles and cool monsters!     (love, monster, crown for royal and the best) this game gets a thumbs up and I rarely give thumbs up! I am on a role on this game, I mean I caught blix and I found another prime creo. Also (I don't know what to call these) I caught 2 shiny creo! Or blue feel because they were blue idk know if they were genecticly modified creo but whatever, I caught a blue illuvian and a blue triopus.          ","Overall, Great! Although... The game is addictive, which is good. Meaning that people want to continuously play this game. But for me, sometimes the app just shut down, and I get frustrated since then I lose all my progress I've made. It's so frustrating since all the hard work you did in that time period, is wasted and useless. Would've been a 5 star if it functioned better.      ",Good game As a Pok mon fan I'd say this is a pretty good game. the game has its differences from Pok mon and feels like it's own game. the Creo look cool I just wish there were a bit more to choose from. One thing I feel is that the Creo you get from the farms are better than the ones you can catch. some Creo need to be buffed stats wise or add new Creo's to the game to make it more interesting. other than that this game is good and id recommend this game to other Pok mon fans.      ,"Best RPG experience I've had in years! The story is fairly in-depth, the dialogue is actually dynamic, and the monster progression system is very unique, and is still easy to use. The battles are actually fun when walking through tall grass, and there are no Zubats trying to swarm you in caves. The Cloud load/save feature is definitely a life saver, and the multitude of avatars you can choose from are awesome! Worth so much more than what the price tag shows.      ",Google plus doesn't work amazing game but when I pull out my creo from the storage I and use them in a battle the game freezes so im stuck to the first 5 creo I obtain      ,"Issue resolved, great game Fantastic game so far, updated to 5 stars after issue being fixed. I couldnt sign in to google play for a cloud save on one device, but then it started working. Im thinking maybe it was because I had the other device running at the same time? Idk but its working now. Pokemon fans will enjoy this alot. If this game gets updated frequently this could be amazing. Im laughing at the people complaining that it's 99 cents haha. So worth every penny.      ","Creo won't learn new moves This game has amazing graphics, a decent story and is a fun way to burn time.  However, recently, everytime my creo ""learn a new move"" after leveling up during battle, I see no new moves at all. And from what I can tell , either no one else has this problem or has noticed it. I notice that in the info page of each creo , there are 3 slots for moves other than your five current ones. No new moves are learned after that.  The tutor isn't helping, and its a huge pain. Will rate 5 stars if this is fixed.      ","Its ok Eh theres a few bugs where it freezes when a battle is about to start and i have to restart the game to get passed it, and there should be more animations, Creo, and more places      ","FANTASTIC alternative to pokemon, one of the best games on android.   This is similar to pokemon in many ways but there are some differences that I like that I think 1 up pokemon.   For 99 cents you can't go wrong. You can cloud save and play this offline too.  It's completely fair if you don't pay for premium currency, it's not necessary at all. You can go through this game just like how you can go through pokemon. There's perks you can get for your trainer too so you aren't hindered.   I plan to support this game further.  This developer has earned my respect.  BUY IT if you like pokemon style games, you have basically nothing to lose but 99 cents, even then there is a 2 hour refund window on google play.      ","sucks now that I purchased it The free version didn't have the annoying store button or the gem counter up in the corner. I'm dissapointed in that. I just paid 99 cents to play a full version that now expects me to spend more money on it? This is kind of a cheap and dirty tactic. I want a refun, or the stupid store option turned off on my game.      ",Crashes Ya know i.actually paid money for this game. And the game itself is a great game. But it crashes so much in the middle of a battle. Find a way to fix this and I'll jump to 5 stars.      ,Great game. Usually. I loved the game before the most recent update. The little arrow that floats around your character is really annoying. I would please ask that you add a way to remove it. I would suggest adding a option menu below the quest line helper in the options. I am sure theres other things that could potentially be added as options as well.      ,Switching devices Don't buy can't switch between devices if you do expect to Lose all Everything your purchases and gems and all your rare creo were developers can't do nothing about.. I SaY please don't waste that dollar      ,"Very Bugged.  Never spend &gt; $1 on this developer. I transferred my files to a new device and premium stuff stopped working correctly. My bought creo do not learn pre evolution moves anymore. It's impossible to fix since the premium devolver only devolves lvl 5 creo. Spent $27 on the entire thing. Support cube ($20) gives logs as ""rare"" items. It's impossible to get the best creo (10*) unless you spend money. The 4 skill points you have left in the end is pointless. The devs respond once per month but did not offer solutions so far.      ",Next Update I really love this game. I hope in the next update there will be new maps and creos. I hope new updates will keep coming.. Best game I bought.. This is the first one though :)      ,"Creative I love the work put into this, it's a great game for a dollar. I've noticed though with updates, freezing is more apparent. I was in the title screen and it crashed, 5 mins in game and it crashes. Hope you guys are working on it.      ","nicely done developers the game, it was amazing there were nothing wrong with the game and no bugs and the animation remind me of old games and a little tip for the developers stay awsome and doing what your good at and ignore the dislikes.      ","This must be a glitch? There's something wrong with the game. I haven't seen a single wild creo with a star ranking above 3. It must be a glitch, right dev? Everyone should avoid this game until this glitch is fixed - in its current state it appears to be an unrepentant cash-grab that expects you to buy creo to progress in the game. I'm sure the dev isn't stupid enough to turn away customers like that on purpose, right?      ","Holy Cow! I honestly did not expect to get this involved in what looks to be a Pok mon clone (but isn't a clone, I like this battle system better!) Way to go!      ","Garbage It ""was"" a decent game.....until half way through, it stopped working. I played for hours and now every time I open the app it just brings up a picture of a small temple on a cliff by the water and freezes...it stays stuck on that screen no matter what I do...so zero stars....I only gave one star in order to comment , but i take that one back too.      ",AMAZING!!! I'm a BIG fan of Steven Universe. I heard of this on YouTube and looked it up and it WAS THERE!! I got it I loved it and I just got 100% on every world   PS: please make new episodes PLEASE !!!      ,"Does not work I purchased this game with high hopes. It looked really good, but i can't play it at all. As others have mentioned, it freezes on a picture of the temple. I'm disappointed and regret spending my money on this.      ","Great game missing one key thing This is a fantastic port but I have one feature request. Could you include play games support for saved game files. I have had my entire progress wiped twice, with one of them being when I was on the last level.      ",This makes me love Steven Universe even more! So much action and it has a nice balance of challenge/not too challenging. Plus I love making my own choices in the conversations you get to have with the crystal gems and the leveling up is so amazing. I played this for hours and didn't notice it had been 4 hours and I still have 3 levels to make 100% I would definitely pay to play more levels as well as more characters and different gem fusions. You get your money's worth guaranteed. Recommended for any age totally!      ,"Enjoyable for everyone Being a huge fan and long time supporter of Steven Universe, this game was a must for me when i first learnt about it. And its everything I could ask for (I replayed and mastered the game around 8 times and i   it) Grumpy studio together with Crewniverse did a great job. Characters acts same as they would during the show voicecasting is perfect, they even use quotes said during episodes and humor is fantastic! (Pearl's ""Are Pee Gees"" are very funny XD ) . I have to pinpoint music and colors, its beautiful.      ","Great ideas...I guess that's it I will honestly say that as a person who couldn't get into the show, I found this game to be...pretty enjoyable for what it was.      ",Good but could be better Needs an update it's very good but if anyone's like me they get bored of it once finished give an update and I give 5 stars            ,Could someone make ghe glitche stop cause i love this game and steven universe too but o wwnt someone to fix the weird freeze of the temple when nothing works i was ar the red world and now i cant play anymore please help ; ( and it would also be awesome if u could add more things like fusion between the gems u want like pearl and amethist that make opal by example please and thank you :)      ,By far the best mobile game I've played to date! Sequels please!!      ,"It's an awesome game..with some software quirks. The game itself is amazing, the gameplay is so fun. The software kinda ruins it a bit. I start it up and it has a long cut scene and I want to skip it. If I do, it disables my touch function? What? So I have to watch it every time. The other thing is some audio hiccups. All around its awesome, so pick it up kids and cartoon loving adults alike!      ","So much fun! Lovable characters, an interesting plot, challenging battles and exciting items! Awesome awesome game, and I generally don't enjoy RPGs. Highly recommended and well worth the money. The only tiny grievance I have is that the graphics could be improved quite a bit, but that hasn't hindered me from loving this game whatsoever.      ","New attack idea I love the alexandrite idea but I think it would be cool if there was a attack where you could fuse just garnet and pearl, just amethyst and pear,and just garnet and amethyst, that would be a idea I would love to see I just get tired of  the only fusion being alexandrite please take my idea into consideration      ","It's not loading?? I downloaded the app, but it's not loading? I don't know, it just stays on a picture of the house with the stone lady but it doesn't load at all. I would rate higher if I could play and I'm very hyped to try to play but only if it works. I tried uninstalling and then downloading it again but nothing changed....what am I suppose to do?      ","Not your usual shovelware Usually you'd be right to avoid cashcow series turning into terrible games and spin-offs, but this title is legitimately worth your time.  It is basically South Park: Stick of Truth, but with a Steven Universe plot, visuals, references, and even new stuff you'd expect to find within the show itself. Not only that, but it's fresh. It doesn't feel like rehashed material, but like an episode of its own. The characters have character, they're written as you would expect them to speak, and there is partial voicing of the dialogue in the most important places.  I have only played through the first world and a little into the second so far, and there has already been a decent amount of referencing to the show that could be considered spoilers. I'm not too sure where this game would be set timeline-wise, but it's definitely somewhat deep into season 1.   Give it a chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you love Steven Universe.      ","Really Great for the Price I truly enjoy this game for not knowing much about the cartoon. This is how a RPG should be. It is sad there is nothing else like this. I would gladly pay more for a sequel out update. My only gripe is the level cap. I am on the third level and already maxed. I hope for a higher level cap, more skills, and maybe different fields in the future.      ","Whats up with this! I love the show, and couldn't wait to get the game! When I enter the game is just shows the temple! I tried restarting my phone, and uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but no luck. Very disappointed. I want my three dollars back, and so do alot of other people.      ","Amazing Can't stop playing, its so much fun the music is nice to listen to. The voice acting sounds great and the balance between its fun and difficulty is perfect.      ",A Fun Way To Pass the Time Very simple and straight forward. A really fun game with just the right amount of difficulty for a mobile game.      ,"Fun but too many touch issues Some touch commands can't be used properly due to lag and or freezing ruining some battles.  It's happened so often I just quit playing now when it happens.  There's time it won't even start up, stuck at the intro screen because it refuses to register my touch and or swipe to start the game.  Unplayable IMO.      ","This a perfect example of a well done mobile RPG, no cluttered controls, good use of touch and fun to boot.      ","Great Game, but more potential This game is an average RPG with all the mechanics of one. The story, while it could have tried to be intergrated with the TV series, it's still good. I think they should have waited a little. By the time they realeased this, Steven was still pretty vanilla,compared him in the show now, and we still didn't get Sardonyx, and Pearl and Amythest's fusion wasn't used alot. It ends up being, the gems are pretty limited in terms of attacks, but the game is still good.      ",Totally worth buying!! This game is really fun and addicting hahaha. I didn't even know that I was playing for 1 hour.      ,"New level Maybe the  next stage will have red,yellow and violet bosses and a new one like light blue ice penguin      ","Amazing game! Okay, might be a bit biased since I love SU, but I love this game.  Simple artstyle and addicting.  What the gems say when you tap or heal is funny and in character. Voice acting is also on point.  Would recommend to anyone who likes SU!      ","BEST GAME EVER! This is one of the best rpgs I've ever seen, so much quality and effort has been put into something very professional and lovable.      ",I want to play this game but I seem to be among those who are having trouble with the game crashing/going blank at the very start.  What kinds of devices are others using that have the same problem??      ,"Very creative and addicting! An essential for any SU fan! If I had one complaint it would be that there's not much to do in the post-game. Once everyone's leveled up, and you've got 100% on everything, there's not much to do but restart.      ","X10!!!!!!!!!! I love this game with a passion!  I've restarted it about 10 times now and collected every single item and badge. My first play through I, I bought every item from the Prism Statue.      ",It's awesome just missing out on sugilite blast and Opal harmony strike hope they add it PLEASE and more levels or at least little quest but they should at least but lion at work!!!      ,"Amazing show, great game I'm glad they made a good game to go with a great show, all I could want from either is more! Hope a sequel gets made and hope the show stays around for a very very long time      ","Steven Mario RPG It's very reminiscent of Super Mario RPG with timed attack/defense and such. Well balanced (slightly difficult), and I'm wagering at least 10+ hours content for 3 bucks. No in-app purchases. This is the best mobile RPG ever.      ",It's good but It needs more bosses more fusions and more characters.Oh and add a secret final boss please!      ,"Wont work I am running on a sony tablet S, it is old but this game isnt working.

",Reminds me of Mario and Luigi Any RPG fans will love this ! It has a very Mario and Luigi style timed attacked system. It's so good!      ,Steven Universe This game is just so good i honestly would not mind paying for a longer sequel      ,"Awesome! But... Can there be a future update with Homeworld gems like Lapis, Jasper, and Peridot? They'd be great to see. Also, could there be a gemsona mode on here where you can do a story of your own? Like it'd be a full on RPG and you decide what you do in the story! That'd be AWESOME! Keep up the good work and I would love.to see more in the future!      ","Super cool game Steven Universe 4EVER, the boss fights are really fun      ",The OMG of Star War games I loved this game more than I could even imagine! It played so flawlessly on my galaxy 5. Please please please come out with part 2!!!      ,"So I've tried everything, I've gone through and deleted everything possible and even downloaded a move sd card app to make room for this game because it's my favorite. I have plenty of memory on my card and evendently the memories are linked some how and still it will not download, so I'm going to refund this for right now      ","Flawless is it? I haven't even played it yet because of an error at the start of the game. I made my character but when it came to the naming it wouldn't let me delete the randomly generated name. I'm only rating this game 3 stars because I've played it on the original Xbox, a PC and on another Android device so I know that it is good but there is a bug in the game. I have restarted my tablet computer and it didn't do anything so now I'm uninstalling and reinstalling it to see if that helps.      ","Had a blast until... Spent about 10+ hours grinding and then half my team disappeared and I couldn't advance because I couldn't find the last guy I needed to progress the story.

","Great port of a classic game!  My only issue so far has been trying to defend the Ebon Hawk in flight, it is nearly impossible to do with only a touchscreen interface since you scroll slowly and have to stop moving to shoot.  Tested on Samsung Galaxy Tab 12.2 and Nexus 6p.  I think this could be overcome by using a gamepad, but all of the other controls have been modified that they work just fine with a touchscreen.

I had also tried to install it on my lenovo s6000 tablet and could do so but all the character models would be all white coloured and not load correctly which is really frustrating seeing as the game runs pretty well other than that.

Great oldschool fun with something for every rpg fan.  Of course the graphics are not modernized but they are good enough to enjoy, as well as helping to set the tone.  The game really sucks you in and is well worth more than the asking price.  Great for 5 minutes, or long playthroughs if you are that lucky lol.

If you like rewarding questing and nostalgic humor in an old-school RPG framework, this game is for you. Chiptunes abound and it runs smooth as silk.

Great game, worth every dime.      ","An RPG'ers Dream A thoroughly fun & addictive turn based RPG that combines elements of Final Fantasy, Dungeons & Dragons, and old school 8-bit aesthetics. Boatloads of retro charm, appealing graphics, a wonderful in-game sense of humor, surprisingly low battery usage and tons of replay value are just icing on the cake. Whether you want to sit and play for 2 hours or pass 20 minutes in a waiting room this is a great time killer.      ","Awesome A RPG based on people playing a RPG?!?!

But somehow in my ZenFone2 it's not working?      ,"Great game, just for some reason when I purchased the 10000 coins I didn't receive it, even though it charged me, can you help?      ","Incredibly Fun! I had a blast playing through this game. It has a surprising amount of depth! I highly recommend this game,  especially if either RPGs and/or D&D are enjoyable to you!      ",Itemss! Add more items or materials and a new enchanting systems such as gems ! And multiplayer version of this APP!      ,Amazing for anyone familiar with Dungeons and Dragons. This RPG mimicking tabletop D&D brings comedy to side quests and meta-gaming. I seriously recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy and comedy.      ,Fixed rotation I love this game. But is there a way to turn off its automatic screen rotation?      ,Crashes on Asus Zenfone 2 Screen just goes black after the Paradox Interactive logo. Excited to play this game but unfortunately doesn't work on Asus Zenfone 2. Will increase my rating once this issue is fixed. Thank you and God bless.      ,"Things are missing I no longer have the option for the haunted falls expansion and in 500+ in-game days, there hasn't been a single grind stone mining deposit      ",Will not load on Zenfone 2 Will not load past the first splash screen on my Zenfone 2. Would rate it 5 stars if I could at least play it. Love this game.      ,"AWESOME game, with a caveat I played the hell out of this gameon iOS, but there is a major Android bug where grindstones-- used to level up the blacksmith-- don't spawn in caves, which really wrecks the game economy. Still no patch in sight, and so I'm wary of investingtoo much time in this until that's fixed.      ",Love the game However I bought some gold and havent received it yet. Been an hour      ,"BEST RPG GAME EVER, WORTH IT Really love the gameplay, so unique and cute. Also i love the pixel art. Kudos!      ",Nodes How can I mine? Can't find any nodes in dungeons.. But I love it!      ,Great game but.. Uhmmmm is there an option to stop the screen rotation? I'd like to play the game in portrait please      ,Excellent! This is the RPG I was looking since a long time and finally I'm so glad to have found it. Really excellent! Bought the DLC and some gold also to show the awesome devs some support. Keep up the great work!      ,was expecting something better too easy. little strategy.. little depth.. glad i dint buy the more expensive version      ,"Not working I love the game, played it on my phone a lot. However the game doesn't want to load on my Asus ZenPad 8, not sure why its doing that if there's a way to shed some light on this issue or if the devs see this comment, I don't want to rate low but I'm not sure what to rate with this issue other then that 5stars easy.      ",Fix the Grindstones Grindstone no longer spawns naturally in the cave areas. Fix for 5 stars.      ,Asus ZenFone2 ml551 - the game doesn't work      ,"Doesn't start on lenovo yoga tab 3 pro I just get the first logo screen, then the screen goes black and nothing.  Looks like it's not compatible with Intel chipsets      ","I don't really get why people are hot on this game. Yeah, it's cute and retro, but the world is super small and there's no over-arching story to tell you what to do next. I had fun with it for a couple days, but now I wish I would've gotten a refund before the sheen wore off. Oh well.      ","Can't work Hi it can't work on Asus zen fone 2, and apparently most of the Asus models. Hope you can fix it maybe? Would greatly appreciate :D.  I tried it on other phone,  Sony,  it works great and I've lost sleep playing it.  It's extremely addictive and awesome! :D. Really hope the developers can do Smth about it.  Thanks in advance! :D      ",Addictive Really fun app. Bring in a new meta game of a cRPG.      ,"No point Coming from someone who's beat this game: The character selection process is rediculous; So many choices but very few are even useful. You can learn all you want about the dungeons as you go along but never be able to use anything you know because items drop randomly and you can't store them anywhere so it doesn't matter how tactful you are; having the right tools is a roll of the dice. It's a glorified game of dice: No strategy involved. If you try to play smart, you're only going to be beat by chance.      ","too difficult chars.keep getting hit by status effects and i have to waste every turn trying to heal. no way to retreat. are there any areas to grind in? what about full screen? im still going to keep trying,i just wish it were a little easier.      ",Fine...5 stars...but... Fun dialogue...challenging...well put together. But inventory needs work...badly. Just drop less loot. Element system and monster system is not done well. Visually tricky and I hate min max my weapons to fight bosses. If on PC id give 6/10 but on Android still 5/5 compared to competition.      ,"   A MATAEUS REVIEW      Well, I'm astonished! What a great game! It's got an excellent learning curve with a great level of challenge, many achievements to unlock and fantastic gameplay. Good humourous writing is accompanied by fantastic graphics and great music, and the whole thing runs super smooth. A really, truly great mobile RPG game!      ","Setbacks are too huge Played for hours on the first ""level"", got killed (due to a mistake with equipping the party) and back to square one. Do not know if I can be bothered putting in the effort again. I really cannot see how you are ever going to get near the even harder levels. Life is too short.      ","Truely well done The game is a retro styled turn based rpg, beautifully done and brutal at times, but easy games are never fun, this game isn't hard by any means but it becomes slowly less forgiving as you progress, basicly a learning curve for those expecting a free ride to victory. Well worth its price.      ","Awesome Multi TOTAL PARTY WIPES Hard as hell. Starting out you are able to pick from 6 random classes for 3 slots. you unlock a variety of quality and curiosity as you beat SPECIFIC dungeons or if you beat more than X dungeons before your guaranteed Total Party Wipe. Robust mechanics system makes for varied and interesting combat and other challenges, which can sometimes  aid or hinder in massive ways, which makes your initial choice of Class NPC selection even more important      ",Fun But is there NO way to get back to town while in a dungeon??? My bag is full so it won't let me advance... but all I can do is trash items and lose them forever.      ,"Needs rotate lock The game itself looks great, but you don't seem to be able to prevent screen rotation even when the device has it switched off, makes if impossible to play when lying down, a small thing but irittating.      ","I have a suggestion For every party death, give small bonuses to future parties.   Each grave could indicate the bonuses, such as 11% more INT for getting far with a mage group. It would add to replay value!      ",Great game But i feel like its almost hard and more frustrating to fight my phone because of the automatic turning of the screen.  If i want to turn the screen i can turn on screen rotation. Fix? Maybe?      ,"Game stalled and failed to run even after re-installing. Contacted the support email address 3 weeks ago, no reply. May be very good but can't recommend as didn't work and support nonexistent.      ","Enjoyable and well done Game is fun to play. Inexpensive and well done. I also enjoy that it plays landscape or portrait, one handed games are hard to find.      ",Love it It's a little confusing in beginning but once you star playing more the game becomes amazing. Fully recommended      ,"Really fun game Took a tiny bit of time to understand the game, but since then, it's been pure fun. The design, game mechanics and writing is great.      ",New go to app! Saw this on steam a little while back and wishlisted it there.  Glad I did because this is an AMAZING mobile game. It is very much suited to a grab and go style of game that I don't usually associate with pc. Seems very complete and full featured.  Easy learning curve and very rewarding.  Couldn't recommend any higher.      ,"Thia game is really fun, and it os challenging at times. Just be prepared with your items to prevent status effects and do more damage, and you will be fine! The only problem I have is that there is not a way to lock your screen.      ","Very brutal old skool Doesnt forgive. Expects you not to suck. In order to advance, set up complementary parties (tank, heals,dps) and look for eq that grants inmmunities. Research the enemies in each dungeon and get resis to their element and use weapons, skills, & spells that they are weak against. First u survive one dungeon, then you start to buildxp and gear, then it is ez.      ",Brilliant game! Yes it is difficult but why make it easy? Trying to get the perfect combination of characters to assist one another is enjoyable and challenging!      ,"Almost perfect Great game and refreshing that there are no micro transactions. I would have played double. My only complaint is that the rotation does not stick with the OS's setting. I love that it can be played landscape or portrait, but I wish there was a toggle to lock it in place. Lying in bed and trying to play is frustrating.      ",Old school feel Love this game it takes me back to dos days playing on pc.      ,"Almost No way to grind, no way to go back town once in dungeon, punishing difficulty. Could have been great, notwithstanding the game doesn't play in full screen, but sadly too many downfalls.      ","Fun, funny and challenging Lots of nerd references tied into the story. Tons of characters and party customizations that will keep you playing for hours.      ",Great game. This game is great for short term or extended play. Best of all (unlike most games) they don't want access to your entire phone to play. A definite bonus.      ,FREAKIN AMAZIN Keep up da good work.      ,"A lot of good things, like no iap bs and good sense of humor. The only thing annoys me is auto rotation. Please provide a landscape only mode and I'll rise my reading to 5-star.      ","Amazing!!! I bought this game because the video was amazing, and the game is even better!!!      ",Screen Can you make an option to lock the screen one way or the other its worth two stars!      ,Stuck loading on asus zenfone2 Dont know why. After i choose the language and fit to screen it stays on loading :(      ,"Love it Honestly love it, keep up the good work      ","Hudl 2 stuck on loading screen Bought this yesterday because I though it looked really good, installed, started and it's still loading apparently lol ^^  I have tried several times but always have the same result unfortunately.      ","Very fun and classic style, funny dialogue. Just dont like how you cant turn around and that the whole game resets when you die.      ",Coooooooooooooool(^v^) I'm play this game a long time and it's very good.      ,"Not working Still freezes at ""loading"" screen on my asus k00e.      ",Great game Can be very challenging at times. Great time waster      ,"Very nice Strange until I grasped it, after which is magic. Update: I can't stop playing since 3 days, hope it doesn't ruin my life :)      ",Best game in existance So worth it      ,THE BEST GAME ON PLAY STORE!!!!      ,"Please patch so this game works on the ASUS Zenfone 2. This game looks fun, but it freezes at the loading screen after I choose what resolution I want to play in.      ","I keep dying Fun, addicting, mobile rpg. Worth it.      ",Upset I had this game on my phone and it broke so I waited for a few months to put it on my tablet and I lost the first dlc I paid for. I love this game and I'll continue to support you guys but just upset      ,"Can't restore purchases of DLC on my new phone. Guess I won't be coming back to this any time soon. A shame, too - it's lots of fun.      ","Loved the game, but... There is no ""New Game+"" right now and after you have cleared the game 100% there is very little to do except trying out different classes/combinations with the same Story. 5 Stars if the devs add something to do after the quests and improve the crafting system a bit... UPDATE: 4 Stars again since my device finally recieved the update      ",[SOLVED] Lost content Changed to five stars again due to developer solving my problem. Great app with great developers.                                                                                                                                                                ***************************************** Old phone broke and when I downloaded the game on my new phone all saves and bought DLC's where gone. Same Google account and samsung account.      ,"Great Sequel Doesn't quite live up to the original for me, but still an amazingly addictive RPG-lite.  I've probably sunk a couple dozen hours into this game already, and the developer continues to release both free and paid content updates.      ",This is better then kopp 1 For me i think this really better then kopp 1 story is better and funny and the battle system waaay better then kopp 1 i dont know why the download for kopp 1 is 100 thosen and kopp 2 is only 10 thosen....at this rate they will lose or the profit will not worth the time and money they spent making this game so this mean no kopp 3....guys dont listen to bad review please buy this game if you liked the first one...belive me more better then the first one...and i hope the dev will make kopp 3 i dont mind paying for lots of dlc if it mean getting kopp 3 and 4 and so on      ,"Problems Solved It took a while, but all the issues I had were fixed.  Fantastic game.      ","Read alot of bad reviews, so didn't get it. That was a mistake. For anyone who played d&d back in the eighties, this is priceless. The very first monster is the freaking tarasque! I about died. I also remember playing with people who had 100+ level demi-gods, 25 all stats, & weapons from dieties & demigods like thors hammer. It's like cmon, really? There's just no way! Love it, please keep content coming!      ","A skeleton of a game, now with DLC! After several freaking months of no updates, they finally release one. Too bad it's DLC, and it's and at mid level players. Also there are still no charms. Why did the previous developers have to give up Knights of pen and paper to these numbskulls?      ","Fun Retro RPG Never played the original, but the artwork in this one seems much better. The quests are good and often amusing, the story may be a little short but the gameplay makes up for it. With free a free content update and a couple of DLC there is no longer an issue with it being too short.      ","DLCs When I said 'add more content', I didn't ment you need to pay for extra stuff in the game, really disappointed in a game I loved before      ","Was upset, but after updates VERY satisfied When game first came out I played it and was really disappointed, but after trying it again after the latest update I love it. .      ",Need More Content New game + please      ,Great mobile rpg It is fantastic and we'll with the money the expansions are big and worthwhile while still not necessary in order to have a good time and you can dump endless hours into finding the perfect party!      ,"Has matured into a nice game Still not quite the same value as the first game, but it's a wonderful game nonetheless      ",Great fun + depth Builds on the first game but much deeper rules.  Somehow also very intuitive and simple for noobs.  Great time killer      ,Bug in gold option The 5 dollar gold option gives only 1500 gold as compared to 10000 from the cheaper option. Feel kinda gypped      ,Fatal Error on boot java.lang.error: signal 11                  was working fine before update      ,LOVE THIS GAME....?;));/;/!!! Knight Of Pen And Paper 2 is the best RPG game...!!!!!!      ,"Good continuation of the series, classes have more in-depth synergies. Enjoyed the improved character creation and the new mechanics around the three dice stats.      ",Great Omg this  game is fantastic      ,"Crashes Otherwise, awesome game.      ","Disappointing followup The original Knights was likely the best mobile game I've played, but this is substantially worse. There's less to do, a world that feels less alive, less characters, less classes, and less story, even with all the DLC. Not to mention the port to Android is sloppy at best. Any time you quit and resume it ends up with a conflicting save that you have to pick one of, and then gives you 1k coins. Every time you start the game. It's lazy at best. Passable if you liked the first &  want a time waster but no more      ","Very poor support I thought this game would be great, and it was, until I couldn't use the weapon enhancement crafting system. I sent an email request to Paradox and had a response from someone who said he didn't know much about the game and that I must not know what I'm doing. I sent back screenshots as evidence and his response was that I must not have those recipes. However, he did not have a clue where to find those recipes. Not to be found, supposed to be there from the beginning. Very disappointed in Paradox.      ","Meh Pretty obvious they've decided, rather than charge the right price up front, to scalp as much money as they can, bit by bit, out of you. The ""main"" game is very bland and quick to complete, most missions lack any real originality or humour like the original game, the expansion pack was even shorter and felt like a cash in, and to make it worse despite my account being linked it still wiped everything after I bought/earned most of the upgrades. Not very impressed. Shame as looked forward to it.      ","Enjoyable Loved it. It had great diversity, a small world and the quests were a bit annoying with travelling across the realm and back for almost every mission. My only request is a bigger world and some sub-quests. Btw the music was awesome!      ","Changed KoPaP1 for all the worse Let me say I loved KoPaP1. But all these mechanic changes in 2 are seriously pissing me off. Conditions are much weaker and more unreliable due to the resist system. Gold income is L O W and makes the game feel like a grind, struggling to get money. Respec costing that much is a joke, how am I supposed to experiment with my builds / characters like that?! I cannot recommend this game, having played the 1st one. Such a letdown.      ",Not bad followup but not enough content for $ I loved the first one. This one pretty good but u blow through initial content really quickly and have to put up more $ for DLC which would b OK but u also get through that quickly.  I found crafting worthless. Would never let me enchant weapons which I never figured out. Needs more DLC and I'll pick it back up but I've seen no signs of this happening.      ,Great. Minus replay This game is great. It has a dungeon and dragons vibe with the dice rolling and being told by a dungeon master at the table. Very awesome; however once you've beaten the game and finished the quests there is nothing to do besides start a new game with the classes you've unlocked. A new game + system or even some kind of end game dungeon with some truly spectacular loot would be fun.   But once you beat the game there's not much to do in terms of replaying it. Now I wouldn't give the game lower than a 4 ever      ,"Can't update to newest version Whenever I go to update, the download bar will fill up, but then it will start downloading again.  After 4 times of this, it gives up.  I love this game, please help me.      ","Would love more content! Great game, wish there was more frequent dlc. But with the quality of the add on content I can see why it is spread out.      ",I disliked it The firs one was a lot better and more fun than this.      ,Long awaited sequel Thank you devs! I have been waiting for this for so long. Just the first character creation page had me orgasmic squeal. You will not know how to live a life till you have played this.      ,Its original Have played this before the dlc and cleared the game was quite good. Be reinstalled it seeing as there is more content only to find out my game has been deleted and even though I've paid for the game I now have to pay again to unlock more story and characters.      ,"---~~~* A Mataeus Review *~~~--- I loved the first game. I still do! I play it on and off even after owning it for years, and am yet to try everything. First impressions of the sequel are great - improved aesthetics, lovely animated icons and excellent playability. Then... It's over. And you buy DLC. Then THAT'S over. The original with +1 is awesome. This is not.      ","Great old school RPG Very tongue in cheek, cool art work. I love this game.      ","Awesome If you've ever played PnP games, you'll find a connection to this game. Lots of fun to play and read.      ",Can't play don't buy it The game crashes randomly after a few minutes of gameplay. Don't buy this game.      ,Well worth it. A sequel to one of my favorite mobile games. Great rpg with humor throughout.      ,End-game campaign fixed :)      ,"Game Progression Halted by Bug Spoilers! In chapter 4, Mell will not break the magic barrier on one of the hills. I can't progress past this point and the bug happens even when I reload the game.      ",Won't download Looks like a cool game but I've been trying all day to download the game via wifi and it always times out and will not download. Need to figure out how to get a refund      ,slapdaqular all over if this game dosnt work on ur phone its not the game its your junk phone with no hdd at all buy a better phone go get a moga pro and play this game      ,Bard's Tale Can not save my game without it becoming corrupted. I really liked the game on the original Nintendo. I was hoping to get an updated version for my tablet.      ,"In-app purchases suck I bought talents for 1.99. The save game that I was told had my purchase never came, and you still took my money. Either you send me my purchase post-haste, or I demand a refund. UPDATE: Now the damn game won't save even on an excellent wifi connection. Get your act together, I'd hate to think i wasted money on an otherwise great game.      ","Fun but has software bug issues...? During game play conversation text suddenly not showing and no voice during conversation with a character.   New players , after first down load of 28MB you will need up to have free storage of 3.7GB for the HD download profile or choose low resolution version download which will take approximately 40% less storage space to download the game. Have fun!      ","Don't bother playing, your saved games will be lost This game is great... until you loose all your progress. Played for nearly 10 hours, trusting the in-game save system (and the Google play backup), and one week, i played without net connection. When I connected back, my actual save was overwritten with the old google play one, making me loose one week of play. Other comments complain about adequate save system / corrupt saved files as well. Don't bother playing, you'll loose your time. I mean, how difficult is it to create a reliable save system ???      ",Update? I don't think that means what you think it means. I really got addicted to this game and everything was working great but then I updated and its been one problem after the other. My save got corrupted the game started glitching out and now my moga controller doesn't work.      ,"It's fun with a good story line. My only complaint is that I bought the bow, but I cant use it yet. Make sure you're nice to the dog and train him to fight.      ","Issue Game works great on my galaxy s5. But I'm having issues in highland park. MELL isn't opening one of the final barriers. Any clue? It's an issue that isn't letting me move forward. I'd like to give it more stars, and verifying install didn't fix it      ",Very Funsy. Nice graphics.  Low price. Small bugs in thr game but nothing too serious so far. Lest nothing that makes me want to stop playing.      ,FUN! Brought from 5 stars to 1. Great game as long as the save works. Corrupts within the first hour and can't load.  This has apparently been an issue since MAY and no comments from the devs or a fix.  Cannot recommend to anyone until fixed.  Very sad as it really is a fun game.  Get your act together please and fix the save issue!      ,Works great on an HTC sv one. Gameplays smooth having a bit of trouble and I'd like to move my controls around but it works amazing and plays just as good if not smoother than on the console. Sodas      ,"Great game, only ONE problem... SO the game is great.   Just one thing,  don't expect your in-app purchases to transfer when you get a new phone. Also, don't expect tech support to get back to you regarding this,  I spent about 20$ and everything is just gone and I haven't received a response to my 3 seperate inquiries. So, besides that, it's awesome. That's the reason for 4 out of 5 stars.      ","Awesome Funny, great graphics and so epic. A must for rpg fans everywhere! Had to drop some stars. Cannot complete it due to save games becoming corrupt... Bit aggravating.      ","Why not? I was skeptical about controls on a mobile (I have a Z3), but actually it works better than most games I've played. I played this game briefly oh so many years ago on PC and I don't regret buying it for mobile. It does drain battery a little and I opted for the larger installation because, you know, PIXELS; but I don't regret getting this game. It's entertaining, absorbing and the port has retained the spirit of the original with the optional purchases not interfeering in anyway. For this price, why not?      ","Great game. Very funny and plays well on the hudl 2 (hi def). Only problem so far is that every time I go back into the game... It claims my save games are damaged. Only way round this is to force a stop on the game via android settings / apps and then go back into the game. A bit disconcerting! Looks like a fair few people are complaining about this. Any chance the devs can sort this in a patch??? If this was fixed, it would be a 5star game.      ","Great game but with buggy save This game deserves 5 stars if only game save wasnt buggy.  I lost 5 hours of offline gameplay when i went online again.  Seems that the game OVERODE my local save with the last save from google drive which was 5 game hours old.  What a waste!! :(  Was having so much fun too! Uninstalling...maybe ill pick it up again in the future but too disheartened to continue.  For others, my advice is to always play while connected to wifi....dont trust offline play until devs fix save bug.      ",Serious waste of money I had bought in game items and halfway through the game all my saves started to become corrupted. Serious problem with the game other than that it is fun. Probably not going to play it anymore because I was so far and now I'm back at the beginning with none of my purchased items.      ,"Space It takes up too much space...... Can't down load the extras to the game because its too large, so I can't play.... Why don't you guys say how much space the game takes before its purchased      ","Funny and fun Great game so far, loving the humour and the combat seems just right for mobile. Hoping at some point I can get a +5 greatsword or the like...      ","Loved the xbox game... ... But this corrupted the moment I saved, and has crashed every time I've opened it since. Need a refund. Very disappointing.      ",I played it on ps2 and this is even more bang for your buck now. The game now includes the msdos original trilogy and gives you options between a standard definition 1.5 gb download or a high definition (equal to the ps2 version) 3.5 gb download. The comedy is entertaining for rpg veterans and potty humored middle schoolers alike. There are different styles of skills to play through with and some different story twists depending on either snarky or pleasent dialog choices. Micro transactions are tucked away in the menus and non-intrusive/necessary.      ,Working great except for the fact that my saved games are constantly becoming damaged somehow.  This is super frustrating.  Played for eight plus hours for nothing.  I like this game a bunch but whats the point if i cant save reliably.  Please fix this.      ,"Snarky Cary Elwes written and performed, accented dialogue, and an action RPG format to design your own party!

I had a problem. The butcher got killed and I could not progress AT ALL. I also spent money on the game. Lost it all. Had to start over from the beginning of tower 2 . five and a half hours of game play just gone. Did not say anything at first and would have given the game like a 10 star but I guess crap happens to paying customers.      ,"Fun, best phone game yet?

It's a nice bonus to include the original trilogy.      ",Hilarious! (Samsung tab 4) Cracks me up every step of the way. Loads of fun. Game play is like Diablo but simpler. It's a must have game! Only complaint is that sometimes I have to exit and close and restart to resolve some bugginess. My save wouldn't load just now and yesterday that dude wouldn't open those electrified walls so I could continue. But I noticed a reboot cures all that so far. I test loading after I save now. Still I'm all about the bards quest and I gotta give it all the stars just from what I've seen it was worth it!      ,"Update messed up multi fire Update today 4/18/15 and on 2/17/15 were not adreesed. Try to battle with a bow, it exposes you to no movement on LG Vista. You can fire but all movement or legends disappear after a double tap.(The newest update when trying to multi fire arrows by tapping now enlarges the screen and cannot move.  On LG Vista 12A. Please fix love the game 5 stars back when you do. Loved this from the original to now. Played them all from the begining!)      ","Perfect! A definite must-have gaming app. Why can't there be more games like this one out there?....update: wanted a great game to play, so 2 years later, on my new s6, the bards tale is STILL awesome!!  Also, i am having no issues with my saves becoming corrupted. Game is working smoothly, as expected.      ","Very silly tongue in cheek ARPG. One of the better mobile games I have across. Then again it is a port to mobile so it should be half way decent anyway, right? Found only one fairly low cost and pointless in app purchase. That was for all the artwork, silly songs and in game movies. All unlockable via gameplay anyway so no problem      ","One problem The game is absolutely brilliant, funny and very addictive but it seems the problem with the saved files getting corrupted has still not been fully fixed since I just lost over 8 hours of gameplay as well and whereas I can pick up the part I was in quite easily by just skipping the dialogues and doing everything as fast as I can, it is still frustrating because nothing seems to work for me and let me keep my saves. Please fix it! Other than that, as a game, full 5 stars.      ","Decent fun Lots of jokes, too frustrating at times with the difficulty. It's like the game can't decide if it wants to be silly and fun, or unreasonably challenging. Too many times I just hit a wall and have to try it 100 times before I randomly win the fight. Funny dialogue.      ","Old School RPG, Has Major Issue. It seems to be a good port. Difficult, yes, but still enjoyable. The only problem is my save will not load. It says the chapter progress is damaged, and should be deleted. I am a good few hours through, and I do not want to start a new save. Does anybody know how I can fix this? It's been a few months since I have been able to play. If the developers can fix this, I'd gladly give it 5 stars.      ","Great game, but it's too buggy! Ever since I started playing, I kept having issues where sometimes cutscenes would not advance. There's a part in the game where a character won't move and you need to quit and reload several times just so you can keep going. I haven't had the cutscene problem anymore, but now, I frequently get told that a save file is damaged and it won't load! And this time, quitting the game won't fix it. Seems like I'll lose all my progress. Fix this, devs, please!      ","Unplayable Wanted to play original series but when ever you have to go to the keyboard it doesn't work. Unable to create new character, type in spell short cut, or use arrow directions. Highly disappointed.      ","Amazing My 2nd favorite storyline in a Dragon Quest game. 7 was the best(my opinion) by faaaaar. DQ 5 is a great game, hate the controls, rather play it on the DS. Still I purchase it in hopes SE would make some console games in the US.      ","Excellent Port I never played the original DQ5 but I always heard it was the best in the series. And I'm actually loving it so far. The music is astounding and although the controls takes some getting used to, I think people looking for a solid JRPG on Android should look no further. Look past the $15- you're getting a worthy game for that price. I do wish the game was overhauled to fit mobile and 'save' anywhere was implemented. Quick Save is such an archaic feature.      ","Finally, DQV! Like the FF series, I have been a big fan of DQ. I have played all the DQ, and have been a huge fan of the story of DQV and have been waiting for this to come to Android! Like DQIV, the controls will take a bit of getting used to, but the game itself is just like I remember, except for the updated dialogue and character names. I personally don't like the changes since I hold the Japanese version close to heart. Regardless, I still give it 5 stars, great game, story, fun! DS version, choose from 3 girls! =D      ","Beyond excellent! Easily one of the best video games of all time. Not only is the story first rate, the turn based battle system crushes the pointless ATBs and action elements of other RPGs. Final Fantasy 6 wishes it was half the quality of game that Dragon Quest 5 is. $15 is a steal for this masterpiece.      ","An excellent traditional JRPG Dragon Quest V is about as pure as JRPGs come. You follow the adventures of a young boy as he grows into an adult. Battles are turn based and challenging. They feel a little unfair sometimes, but never unbeatable. There is a lot of grinding. Expect to fight many battles to earn the levels and money needed to face the challenges at hand. There is a monster capturing element that also takes time. The graphics are nice yet pixelated, and the controls are unwieldy but functional. Highly recommended!      ","No quick save makes it a real DQ This is my first RPG game ever back on its first release on SFC in early 90s.  This certainly brings back lot of memories.  I dont know if I should be complaining the fact it doesn't have quick save function like all the other remakes in its series.  As this makes DQ5 much more harder to play just like the original one, but also means I have to keep the game running in the  background if I'm not next to a church to safe my process.  Nevertheless, it's definitely a 5/5!      ","Early consisten crash Right after the beginner dungeon, I go home and sleep, wake up and the game freezes up on my lg g4.  Every. Single. Time. The control pad disappears and I'm left staring stupidly at the screen.  This is completely unplayable.      ","Good story, bad RNG monster recruitment DQ5 has a great story but lack original characters like DQ4. Except Deborah, all characters are bland. DQ5 features monsters recruitment which sounds great at first but it is poorly executed due to too much RNG. Some monsters are really hard too recruit (healers especially...  Only monster get Omniheal...  3% chance and less to recruit)  and you can easily spend hours and days fighting the same monster and might never get it which brings a lot of frustration and no fun.      ","Don't let controls complains deter you First let me say this is my first dragon quest rpg to date and while I have yet to finish It, I feel bad for missing out all these years.  Admittedly the controls are a little shaky, especially at first, as it can be a little difficult making a precise turn into a stairway sometimes.  However the benefits of having a clean interface that obscures so little of what is even in this age a very beautifully designed and animated game far outweigh the occasional directional hiccup.  Definitely a must buy!      ","You did it again. Why? My arthritis makes it extremely difficult to play a game of this complexity without a stylus. You obviously can make a game compatible with my S-pen. DQ1, DQ2, DQ3, FF1, FF5, FF6...all are compatible with the S-pen. DQ4,  DQ5, and DQ8 are not. I see the pattern now, though. Thanks to your short - sightedness,  I won't even bother with DQ6. Thanks, SE. It was a good run while it lasted. I guess I will just have to stick with Final Fantasy and blow off Dragon Quest.      ",Good times Dragon quest V probably my favourite among them. Though I prefer the old dejap translation from the snes version. Like all the phone rpgs I've played I find the controls finicky the dpad deciding to go down when hitting up.      ,Autosave is garbage While the game is great the autosave is not.  Answer a phone call and you could lose more than an hour of gameplay because it won't auto save in a dungeon. Happened to me 3 times already (and once after recruiting a rare monster).      ,EPIC I so love this game. DQ V is among my favorite in the series. I can't wait for VI. I like how like with DS they gave you Deborah to choose. She is by far my favorite bride      ,"Another hit Just have to ask. Once you get back to Dragon quest 8, will you make 9 and 10? Thats how many there are right? 10 Dragon quests?      ",Please fix the game cause when it updates everytime my profile is deleted . I didnt buy this game for it to delete on me.

The controls are at best, terrible. The game also only allows for portrait mode, why can't SE allow landscape mode as well? Limited, half-assed port. Would be better to buy a NDS & this game.      ","Awesome A flawless port of the DS version, with some added touches to the GUI and optimised for Android devices, it runs incredibly smooth, the controls are a little weird at first, but after a few minutes you get used to it and it feels natural, keep up the good work.      ","Just a little feedback... The game is great as it is now, but I would like to se some little tweaks to the battle interface, at least to the characters' portraits.      ",Never played the original DQ5 I just got to the second generation and its a good challenge. Requires some grinding but not too excessive (not yet anyways) I like the story so far.      ,"Great Game It's good. Can't really say much negative things about this game, besides the grindy nature,  but that's a flaw of the series in general      ",Great game! It's really a shame that the Dragon Warrior/Quest games are not more popular in North America becuase they really are great games. Been playing them sence the 80s and this is my first time playing 5. It's plays well and so far the story is really good. It really goes to show that smart phones can be good for legitimate gameing and not just crappy micro transaction games. This is a real rpg ment to be a fun rpg. I am very much so looking forward to dq7 hitting the app store as the origonal was my favorite.      ,"FIVE STARS!!!  I put 1 to get attention.  I REALLY want DQ VII for 3DS, but if SE only releases it for mobile I will still buy it.  #DRAGONQUESTFORTHEWEST !!!      ","Great game, also for those who are unaware, there is a quiksave function just open the menu, and for the controls you don't exactly have to use the d-pad, touch and drag from anywhere on the screen and it still works. STOP WHINING... love the series lol      ","Thank you! Never had the chance to beat 5 & 6.  Excellent ports, THANK YOU!  - Droid Turbo.      ",Please add Quick save everywhere Love the game. Please add the ability to quick save anywhere. It's a mobile game and I don't want to have to search for a save point to stop playing.      ,Galaxy S3 Only played an hour of it so far and I like it except I feel the control pad is too sensitive      ,"Runs smooth, no crashes yet.  Switching apps, this one is always right where I left it.  Amazing game, and a solid implementation on Android.  Well done!

Would love to play this on Nvidia shield handheld or TV.      ,"Every little interruption causes loss of progress Everything, every phone call, text, and alert that you check or answer and you lose all your progress going back to your last auto save this is absolutely game breaking. Didn't notice untill it was too late now I can't get my money back.... thanks alot... add a quick save function and this game would be a 5/5.      ","Great Game, but Android port still needs lots of work I was thoroughly enjoying this game, until I got to the ""ten years later"". At which point, the game simply ceased to work. It will come up, allow me to load my status, then freeze when I start to explore. And it never freezes in the same spot twice. $10 wasted.      ",Omg! This is the best dragon quest game ever! Thank you very much SE!      ,Love it but. Please make dragon quest  1 and 2 available for the note 4      ,"Best game! Works well on my LG android phone, the game is worth playing but the controls take a while to get used to.      ",Awesome! It's great to see these games coming to mobile. Especially not free to play. Full game 1 time fee just like it should be.      ,Great story My favorite storyline in the series.   Glad to have it on mobile finally.      ,A classic finally portable Yes I know this is on Nintendo DS but what I really like about this version is that it has cloud backup capabilities. Now I don't have to worry about loosing my DS with dq5 in the cartridge slot and permanently losing my progress. The only down fall to this game is that its too big for my 4gb HTC Desire so I have to play it on my very heavy tablet. It gets tiring having to constantly hold my tablet when I'm playing this game. It'd be nice if an update were released that gave the game auto screen rotate capabilities so I could use my tablet's kickstand and rest it on my chest when I'm playing.      ,Autosave... Isn't reliable. It isn't mean closing the game at all. It's still in my active tasks but I just lost a hour or so of grinding. That's infuriating. Please fix squarenex the game deserves better than that.  It happens after 10 minutes or so of being put in background processes. Squareenix I know youve been unreliable with supporting your games. Please don't suck this time.      ,"Great game,  great price Easy controls and never freezes or crashes. Same $$$ as used game store.      ",Best game ever I would give this a 1000000000000000000000000000000000000 stars if I could This is officially my favourite game in the universe if there was a remake on the Nintendo nx this year I would pay the full price as long as I could transfer my game data from this version      ,Please do this Imagine if prodigal isn't dead she just got taken to versus. That would be the best plot twist ever!      ,"Worth the money At first, I wasn't really into the story. The beginning didn't grab my attention and the culture felt like it could be presented better. That being said, the story really grew on me and I felt the culture was present MUCH better later on in the story. I enjoyed the characters and I can tell...this can become a very large series. Well done  .      ","Boring, do not buy. The story refuses to progress as if it's dragging it's feet. Every chance to move forward is replaced by needless descriptions.  I love COG stories but I wouldn't recommend this one. It's a shame I paid first to find out I didn't like it. At all.      ","Where to Begin... It feels like you're stuck in a constant prologue. Not to mention that the narrative seems to punish you if you don't agree with the ""preferred"" path designated by the author. The two characters open for a romance are, quite honestly, appalling to me on a moral standpoint. Wait for the next one...and check its reviews on the choice of games website and forum.      ",Great Love the descriptions and choice of action. One of the best choice of games i have ever played. Love intergalactic games and things that reference real life societal situations.      ,WOW I have played many choice of games before. But man!! This blows them all away. I cannot WAIT for the next one. I never wanted it to end!      ,The best one yet This is by far the best works I've read by you guys so far. Longest book I have read from you guys so far and very interesting. Absolutely willing to wait as long as it takes for the next part to arrive. Well done guys I'm totally impressed with this book.      ,"Just read it! No seriously! I enjoyed reading this book soooo much. If you're thinking about getting it, just do it!      ",Really loved the first book can't wait to see the next the characters are all  so individual with their own goals and desires it's great getting to know them seeing how different they all are and the story is so well written I can visualize how it all looks and feal to be on planet versus.      ,"I love the heck out of this, sure sometimes there's a bit of a stumble and I need to reread to understand, but its worth the money      ",Amazing I love this one so much the story and the decisions you can make plus the powers you can get just amazing!      ,"Details I really enjoyed the depth of this read.  Hoping the new book comes out soon. Thanks for putting so much work into this, it shines through in the experience.      ",Great story I am definately going to reread to unlock all the acheivements.      ,"Can't wait for the next one! I got done reading the Hero's Rise trilogy and needed another great choice of games novel. Versus is just what I needed. I love the story and the stats pages. This game has a great story and your choices build up your character as if it's and rpg. Lots of choices and romance options and achievements are huge plusses for me. My only complaint would be that this is a 123k word novel when I'm used to 200-250k word novels for the same price. Wish this was longer and hoping the next one is. Still, 5 stars!!!      ","Can't wait for the sequel Loved this book, although there are a lot of spelling mistakes,  which can be off putting.      ","Liars Game is priced at $4. I buy the game for $4. Twenty minutes in the game is trying to get me to pay another dollar to ""unlock"" another feature.      ","Omg I loved all of it. The relationships, stats, and how it made me feel.

Looking forward to the next instalment!      ","Great game, but... Only opens if you have an internet connection  which somewhat defeats the purpose of a mobile game.      ","Good game, bad world movement I'll start off by saying I've played this game ALOT at different points in my life, so it is a great game for sure. If you have the option to, I'd say play it on snes, gba, or emulation of one of those. The movement is so stiff and I'm not sure I'll fully get used to it. The movement pad will 'stick' on screen for a few seconds after you let go while trying to adjust, so it is very anti user friendly. I played ff3, ff4, and ff5 without any qualms about their movement system, so not sure why they changed ff6      ",Not connecting grrr Just keeps coming up Connection lost and can't open  I payed good money for this and it should work flawlessly  and should be able to pay with out Internet connection    FIX THIS NOW         ,The Touch Screen D-Pad Sucks!!! The on-screen D-Pad is just horrible and its pointless to try and play while I'm out and about. Good thing it has bluetooth controller support or I would have wasted my money.      ,"Great game Just one issue ,i have a problem start up wise ..like why do i have to have a network connection for the game just to start up it should be able to start up offline without the need for a connection please fix this ,as for the rest of the game its great brings me back to super nes days and then foward to todays technology ,a very good looking game      ","My God I Love This Game! My favorite game of all time! Used to have to rely on emulators to play on the go, but this new version is fantastic so far. No issues whatsoever, I'm loving everything about it. Clouds saves are great. Kind of bothered by the need for a connection to play, how can I kill time in the woods if the game won't initiate? (2013 Moto X, Fire Phone CM11)      ",Controls are bad Not very far into the game yet but it doesn't take long to notice how bad the controls are. I have been playing FFV and the controls are amazing. Then to come to this its a real shock. Besides the controls it looks great. Fix the controls and I'd give 5 stars.      ,"A good remake The classic is reborn with new and updated character models and updates backgrounds.  I am not that far in yet but so far the game is fun and enjoyable.   Some of the text is a little different from the SNES version you might remember but nothing major so far.    The worst part so far is the control pad...it is really hard to get used to and could use some tweaking....perhaps something more along the lines of what Final Fantasy Dimensions contained.   No other complaints, the game game runs well.      ","Love the game but hate.... The game is great. Only thing I have a complaint about is it needs an internet connection to launch every time.... I understand doing it once in while, like once or twice a month every time is ridiculous.      ",Favorite game of my childhood Only thing i don't  like is the directional pad center moves around screen want option to anchor it more like the snes emulator easier to use fine controls.      ,"Was great, but is stuck in a loop Battling to protect Banon, half way through the game, a soldier reached him so now I get to watch the same 1 second of game play perpetually. Dumb. Lazy.      ","Online only SNES game? Bought this for plane flights with no connectivity, for which it is completely useless. Game won't even open.      ","I still hate the fishing, but... Overall I can't come up with a good complaint, bringing back one of my favourite childhood jrpg's just melts my heart. 5/5 nostalgia stars      ","Seriously? The game is very enjoyable. There are some MAJOR problems though. Sabins blitz commands aren't in the game. And the game freezes is Thamasa. Has anyone gotten past this? Without spoiling anything it's right when Kefka says ""illusion"". Cyan is actually useful now because you don't have to wait while he charges. You select the command and he waits while you can give your other characters commands. The control out of battle is a bit weird. Fix the freezing issue and I'll give it a 5 star.  *Fixed bugs.      ","Great game but some issues with this version. A few things.. #1. People have already mentioned that the game should be accessible offline and I definitely agree with this. #2. Is it possible to 'fix' the d-pad rather than having it come up and go away? It would be so much less hassle if it could just stay in a place. With the way it is now, it jumps around and gets extremely annoying! #3. Is there a setting to make the screen not turn off while the game is open? This is also quite irritating and causes the game to crash at times =/      ",Very great This is a very great version of this game good work on making it but the only setback is that it drains battery very quick other than that its great      ,"Clunky interface, but excellent game D-pad is not good. It's too big and doesn't disappear immediately when we remove our finger from the screen. It's really frustrating at times. Wayward Soul is much better in that respect. It's easily fixed and I hope they will do it. Battle control are not perfect either, but good enough. Drains a LOT of battery. Overall it's still very enjoyable. My favorite FF of all time! The game by itself is 5 stars. The port, only 4 stars, which saddens me. I want to give 5, but honestly can't. Still recommended!      ","Game is fantastic, controls VERY ANNOYING This is my favorite game, yet the controls are blocky and the lag on movement is horrible, I'm to the end of the world of balance about 17hrs of gameplay and I still have not been able to get adjusted to the controls, I feel bad for first time players especially for parts that are timed like the Opera scene/ultros I had to redo 2x myself considering it's impossible to not run into/avoid enemies and even worse walls because of the movement controls. Furthermore, controls+sprint shoes=WORSE FIX PLEASE      ","Classic game. Great port. FFVI easily ranks high on my list of my favorite games of all time. I don't know how many times I've played through it in the past, but it definitely a game I can play over and over so I had to buy this. My first impressions of this port are extremely positive. The graphics look great and I love that you can play it entirely and comfortably with one hand. Easily one of the better Final Fantasy games. I couldn't recommend this more.      ","Fantastic game, sometimes glitchy This is a great port of FFVI! It has all of the awesomeness of the original and more, with achievements making it even more challenging and fun. The quick save feature helps when issuse arise with your phone. The app crashes from time to time, most frequently when Gau returns from learning rage techs in the Veldt, wasting a lot of valuable time when trying to do so. Other than that, great game!      ","Great additional content, graphics, auto battle! My favorite game for SNES. Many improvements in this iOS version are appreciated! The D-pad is based on where you touch the screen, which makes tonnes of sense, because at different points in the game you want to move the D-pad so you can see surroundings. Dragons den is fantastic add-on. Love quick save option. Some of the updated translations are better, some worse. I wish combat controls were clearer, I select the wrong monster all the time. Never crashes, runs smooth on HTC One M8. Buy this!      ","Great game. Draconian online only DRM. This is a great port of an amazing game. The controls are a bit dodgy, but the game is otherwise fantastic. The biggest black mark against the game which prevents me from giving a five star rating is the disgusting anti-consumer DRM that requires you always be online to play the MOBILE game you paid for. This game is essentially a rental since you'll no longer be able to play it when the authentication servers are shut down. Remove the DRM and I'll give it five stars.      ","Improved Got this on a sale and was bugged by a horrible control lag.  The lag is gone now,  we'll,  almost.  So here's 5 stars    time to relive my most cherished rpg memory        ","Great Game & Work... Loved this game growing up and with the face lift this app gave it Love it still. No problems with loading, saving, Internet connection, cursor, nor Sabins Blitz cursor which was worried wasn't going to be smooth when downloading but in fact works great. Minor issue in recovering Locke from Star Mountain Range, when using Strago, Mog character shows in place of during battle scenes, though all actions including Lore remains. Look Greatly Forward to continuing the Final Fantasy collection, completed all prev      ","Crummy Control I purchased this game thinking I would  be playing one of my all-time favorite Final Fantasy games. Everything is here , including some revamped graphics. However; the game suffers from very poor controls. I've tried the 4 way and the 8-way controls. Each lags severely. Also at key points in the game , it can disrupt gameplay. 1 key place is the opera scene. I hate that my experience with this awesome game has been tarnished simply by game controls. And, I honestly wish there was a way to get my money back.      ",Can't stop I can't stop playing this game. Had every version sense the SNES. Story never gets old and the main villain you can't help but love and hate      ,"Awesome. Always wanted to experience this game and now I finally get to on a touchscreen!!! The cloud save is an awesome feature! I can play seamlessly with more than one device. The game has awesome music. Only problem w the game is that I wish thr graphics were morr consistant. Either redo all the graphics one way, or leave it.      ",Very nice mobile remaster Brings back a lot of memories. If you are a ff fan then it's worth the admission.      ,"Not perfect I just finished ff4 and ff5 on android and both were good.  Ff6, the on screen controller is much more clumsy feeling than 4 or 5.  My other major complaint is that it crashes when you try to open it while offline.      ","Best Game of All Time I was a long time fan of ff7, and always scoffed at those who said this game was better. Well, I stand corrected. This game changed how I perceive reality; it really is that excellent. The movement can be a bit squirrelly at times but the game is so sexy that it is easily overlooked. Buy it.      ","I have no idea why, but this game consumes a *ton* of battery.  It even seems to use battery even while it's in the background, unless you force close.  Combined with the DRM that requires an Internet connection to play, and you may have trouble getting this game to run on wi-fi only devices while travelling.      ",Great format Great integration to a mobile device.  The format is great and easy to use.  Loved it way back when and love it now.      ,The game is awesome and works great. Just one problem Looks great and runs good but there is no way to save the game data on the external sd. This is bad because I can't have II III IV and this at the same time      ,"Always loved FF6 for the snes Love this game, replayed so many times, not sure what the point in changing Terra's name at one point was for, but still love this game      ","Love the game but... The quick save feature just cost me hours of play time. If your party falls, don't let it load the data itself because it'll load the last file saved at a save point and delete your quick save... :(      ","WTF this is a good game, but all of my saves SUDDENLY DISAPEARED (after a phone update?)......what's going on! So upset wth      ","Brilliant so long as you have internet Brilliant game, never played the original but the story and play is really good. That being said, you do need an internet connection to even start it so I would advise (as others have) against this if you had planned on doing this whilst travelling without frustration!      ",5 star if the controls weren't awful Love the game and the graphics look great. The only flaw is the on screen controls. Just awful. Forget about wearing sprint boots.      ,"Crashes still Man, I love this game, but I can't play it. After a few minutes of playing, I get a message saying that Google Play is experiencing unknown issues. Then directly after the next battle is over, the game crashes. I'll sometimes make it Mt. Koltz but only because quick save automatically marks my progress at each new area. I've never gotten past Vargas without a crash. All my other apps work fine.      ",Best game ever But online based and the fact its on 50% sale while the price doesnt change. And the developers dont care much about customer service      ,"OPTIMIZE, OPTIMIZE, OPTIMIZE!!! Optimize this game for the Samsung Galaxy S6, That's all I ask for, it lags so much, it makes it Unplayable. Not to mention, it there's a never ending loading screen, This game is miles away from the perfect MMORPG, However the first one I'd say is far superior to this one, Graphics isn't everything.      ",Great game bad update :( Game is awesome and addictive. Good game play great graphics. Ever since update I have had server connection issues. I'm lucky if I can even sign on now. Please fix      ,"From 1s to 3s! Why? I can play straight now with 0 crashes! Unless my network sucks! 3s for unfair chest/draw items. Like 99% will just give you unworthy stuff. Even if you spend,same result!hard to play party dungeons because of small volume of players!mount dissappears when activating things,changing locations,& when hit by enemies!annoying feature!      ","It's an alright MMO... OnC2 isn't a terrible game, but, it has its faults. Such as: Pay2win if you're aiming to be at the top. Some events require runes, like, Nicks Treasure thing, which required you to pay Runes only to get lucky to get Runes, liek, wut? People do complain about the Vigor system, I don't mind since I don't play for a long time, I'm also not aiming for the top. It also does run a little slow, but, that's only my device, so, not a big deal. Overall, if you're looking for a decent MMO, try it out. But, if you aim for the top, avoid it.      ","Story quests broken Hours of time effort and energy, only to have a main quest line break, with no fix. That was 6 months ago....still broken, no fix, money spent and no compensation. Was asked to make a new character, after I had already spent 10ish dollars buying gems and upgrades for the now broken character.      ","Awesome game, make heritage weapons more available. It's visually stunning and the battle system is fairly smooth. My problem is that the sensors are kinda whacky sometimes and things get laggy. Playing on the Note 4. Also, make other heritage weapons available outside your crappy lottery system please, kind of lame that you only get a sword. Can't even sell them on auction, very lame. 3 stars just for that. But overall, as far as mobile mmorpg's go, this really is a gem. Worth playing.      ","Great graffix Ok the best mmorpg online now...adventure, crafting your own items, great storyline, and more...      ",good game but now I cant play it it is a really good game and enjoyable... but after the latest update the game is now stuck around 52% game doesnt freeze but it just wont load . pls fix this      ,"I love this game but there is one problem This game is very fun and addictive, when you have time on your hands i recommend you play this, just the only problem is it seems to like to crash about every 20 minutes to 30 minutes on my android device. Other than that the game is amazing      ",Vigor system annoying Vigor system sucks and is annoying. Can't gain experience as fast if you run out. Can't speed run and level up fast.      ,"Awesome Experience Love it, runs great even on 3g/4g. I have faded away from pc mmorpgs because i am always doing stuff now. I find myself playing this game whenever i have time and its possible, then when i have a night to watch tv with the wife and be lazy i can sit down in my lounge chair and then raid, dungeon, pvp, craft, level grind ect and its all fun. Its awesome how it gives me the nostalgic feeling of the first years of some of my favorite mmos on pc , EQ , EQ2, WoW, and SWtOR.      ","Better than the 1st one so far Lots of quests, and they are usually set up so theres not much back & forth. Great graphics, really only complaint is vigor, but with a game this great thats free, I can live with a daily experience allowance, I still play for hours.      ",Loved it! Awsome gameplay!best graphics!best RPG mmo on Google play !need some improvement in speed       ,Please have facebook account  auto log in A good game.. I'd  rate  it higher  if you could auto log in an account synced in Facebook so I wouldn't have to reconnect everytime I  log in the game      ,Awesomeness I LOVE this game. There are  few bugs that still need to be ironed out when making a purchase. Otherwise this is an awesome game. I have been looking for a mobile game that reminded me of WoW and I have found it the Order & Chaos games.      ,"Awesome sequel! I loved Order and Chaos cause its like a free WoW, and this one seems to be just as good, if not better than the original. The Heritage weapons are cool. They remind me of the weapons in Darksiders II that could be made stronger by sacrificing other weapons into them      ",In game purchases broken for newer phones.  Cannot purchase any gems in game on my galaxy s7 edge. Fix please!      ,Fix your update It was 5 stars but now it's 1 due to the fact I can sign in or play. Going back to 1      ,EXACTLY like WoW!

I played the first one, and this one is light years above.

WOW! This game is so addictive I've either got no time or battery left to play the others I have on my phone and I can play it laying back on my sofa, sweet! Unfortunately at the moment even though the game it's self needs a wifi connection to even play it whenever I try to purchase runes I get a message saying ""check wifi connection.""? Then even if I could purchase any you swap the rune totals mid event or somehow run out?      ",Nice Game This is a very nice game and in my opinion it is better than the first one. The graphics are better and the UI is cleaner. Not to mention it runs very well on my low end phone. So far no complaints...Well done Gameloft!      ,New update! Minor bug fixes and new major bug updates! Chat dissappears and players are crashing!      ,Haven't gotten near a mount yet but still have a lot of armor up grading to do still an amazing game thus far      ,Loading glitch I got to play for about 1 hour and decided I wanted to make a new character i exited the game because I thought it would auto save I opened the game and the loading screen stopped at 53% please fix it      ,"The greed Downloaded again after taking time off from the game. Neat to see new updates, typical how much runes everything costs. Gameloft has become so greedy, Id rather uninstall.      ",Idiots! Do you know im very mad!

",How to get vigor Fck i cant do the quest man come on      ,"Frustrating Cannot purchse gems. Game gives me a Easter themed screen that says it, ""cannot connect to server. Try again later."" I would think any mobile game would prioritize making sure its microtransactions work. A week aftwr post I still don't have a answer. Please tell me who I need to contact to solve this.      ",Well played Needs a betterchatting system.. its pretty hard to see... maybe switch the chatting section and the skills section that way more space will be given for chats.. and make a dungeon that's accesable all the time like ragnarok...

As from my review title this could be awesome, and for me the on screen control's don't seem very responsive. You seem to have big on screen buttons, but only a certain area of them seem to work.So please Teemo could you work on control improvements please!.But on the plus side this game seems really nice from what I've played at the beginning so far, but any chance we could have a save anywhere when we like!.

The concept is great. The animations are fun. What I don't like is updates that turn the game into an impossible mission, unless you buy, buy, buy. You've turned Expeditions from 'Fun' to 'Fu@#!'. Now, I'm not understanding why I'm able to defeat Harder than Hard in one quest on The Mountain, but suddenly can't beat Hard in another quest. I like this game, but your growing greed is ruining it.

I paid for a 'One time offer' deal in the Diamond shop. Paid about $30 on a deal for a 'Special sack of diamonds'. Didn't get what I paid for. Contacted support and got told several times I was blatantly lying. Sent the photos of the game for proof, also sent them the receipt I got in the mail for it. They then tell me: ""Well you can purchase it again if you want then.""  Why would anyone buy something again if they didn't get what they paid for in the first place??? I'm not going to walk into a store, buy something and only get half of what I paid for. That doesn't make sense. What a money grabbing company that they can't help the paying customers with issues.  If you have ANY issues with money, they will pretty much laugh at you and tell you the answer is to spend more on the game instead of fixing the issue.      ","Addictive I'm strangely impressed. I only installed this for gems in another game. I usually HATE this genre of game and normally only play for a few minutes then uninstalling, but I'm finding this a lot of fun      ","Funny and exciting! I felt like everything was well thought-out and pleasant, a true separation of quality from other games.      ","Great concept and interesting characters. Energy to perform actions replenishes very slowly. Resources (gems, gold, energy, etc.) do not last very long. You can get diamonds through offers, but they are hit and miss. Don't bother with survey offers, especially if they have a high diamond value. The sponsors try hard to confuse you and redirect you off track - even if you are able to navigate their maze of redirection, they rarely pay out. You can play for free but it will take you forever to be competitive vs. people who spend money. Basically it is a pay to win game, but it is pretty addictive.      ",Addicting Started because of cash for apps. Can't stop. Easy idle rpg that's incredible addicting with hillarious names and captions hidden in. Great app      ,"Kinda crappy The game itself is alright, easy to keep busy and I rarely run out of energy.. force closes all the time though which makes me lose my experience and rewards after a battle. Sometimes it restarts multiple times in a row or loses connection to the server. I am deleting soon if they don't fix the connection problems, it's really annoying to have the game crashing all the time.      ",Amazing app I played it the first time in my life and instantly became in love with the game. Every time I am bored or just lazy that game is always there for me and snapchat! Lol       ,"Amazing 0 glitches, suuuuperrrr addicting, new characters and awesome levels it totally deserves 5 stars      ","Fun yet disappointing Too much $ invested to quit. It is a fun game. However, there are many issues and annoyances relative to cost. Little is done to appease loyal supporters for glitches that result in loss of in game items and time invested. I hope they fine tune this game and show some love back towards the player community that supports it. There are no excuses for the amount of errors that exist. More forgiveness would be offered if the dev's delivered more attention to the issues at hand with humility and transparency.      ","GAME RUINED Runes have completely ruined this game. Love that I've spent over $1000 on this game for you to completely change the gameplay. This game is trash now. Server crashes on a regular basis, updates that fix one thing and break 10 more. I feel cheated and scammed. I will never download or play another PerBlue game ever!      ","The game overall is pretty fun.   Heroes are quirky and amusing, the animation is well done, and game features are all pretty good.   There are a few balance issues, but they are working on them often.   Updates come on regular basis and generally well done.    Support is slow, but if you don't need any, the game is well worth it,      ",Fun and addictive. I love the game and sneak play all the time even during the night. If you have an issue then the PerBlue team addresses it and works diligently to resolve it. Graphics are great and heroes are hilarious.      ,"Funny n classy mmm likin it actually.pity I had to turn off the chat....most the conversation is unnecessary and totally disgusting to be slagged off in a game by immature idiots who cnt stop spilling abuse n rubbish...apart from that this game is brill,sorry to down grade from 5star because of your patrons      ","Fun time wasting RPG. An entertainingly light hearted style and interesting character/skill combinations keep this simple RPG fun. Yeah, it's a freemium game, but doesn't ram it down your throat as long as you don't get caught up in the rankings.      ","Boring & slow. Ugly graphics, boring game play, incredibly slow fights that are entirely too repetitive. I was hoping the comedic writing might help but the humor isn't very entertaining.      ","Getting more tedious with every update. I think perblue forgot this is a phone app, and not a massive rpg. Drop rates are terrible. Stamina  refreshes cost too much with bad returns. Game is completely unbalanced now. People quitting left and right... you dropped the ball pb.      ","Pretty Good I like the slight comic tone to it. *Updated review* higher levels are garbage out of balance nonsense. Becomes a frustrating waste of time. Sad too, for how much I supported it.      ",Recommend your game...NEVER! Since the last update your game is horrible it was unfair to non paying player but now its even worse..its so sad because it use to be fun to play. Now it is only fun for those who spend big bucks..games are suppose to be fun. Also if your not interested in hearing what your player have to say do not fix your posting ideas and problems..just proves what we all know you guys are only interested in the money you can take and not the quality and enjoyment in playing your game. I have been playing this game for 5 months but i will not recommend it to anyone do not down load game no fun to play!      ,"Lore Stormrider I love this game and play every day but the glitches in pit fight etc are so frustrating. I spend gems to get extra fights and click on fight. It sits there saying loading until my phone falls asleep. I back out and I lose the fight chance. If I wait for less than 10 mins and try again, paying gems for an early fight it takes them and sits there with loading until my phone falls asleep again maybe 5 full minutes later. Ive just wasted 500 gems and got no fights so im losing time on my pit countdown. Annoyed      ",New patches have ruined this game and turned it into a blatant grab for your money. Way too easy to make op teams and heroes are not remotely balanced.  Screw you for messing up a perfectly good game.      ,Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 After recent update more crashes happen. Why is it u developers like adding more content b4 you fix the errors/crashes? Folks will eventually wake up to ur greedy obssession and uninstall this game like i'm going to do. Sick and tired of trying to contact support for help wen they dont do nuthin.      ,"Fun, zany humor. Addictive & can be expensive! Loads of fun, especially when you find the right guild. You can play the game quite comfortably with the ""Monthly"" deal ($2.99) which will net you a daily infusion of Diamonds and Raid Tickets and along with 180 Free Stamina you can have a lot of play for a dime a day! If you want to spend real cash you can, just be aware that in game prices go up exponentially! What seems like a lot can evaporate rather quickly... Also, as of this review, they have 5 servers. You can create heroes on all 5!!!      ","DON'T SPEND YOUR REAL MONEY ON THIS! You basically are required to spend money if you want to play this game.  And for the absurd amount you have to spend to do anything you'd think they would make this a good game.. However,  the incredible amount of times per day that it crashes and you lose data make this a very frustrating game to play. **UPDATE : Seriously,  this game freezes up and malfunctions more than any other I've ever played. I want my money back. ***UPDATE 2*** UNINSTALLING THIS. It is so full of glitches and errors. Refund my $.      ","Horrible customer  service I loved  this game until the updates and glitches.  As a level 12 VIP ,  I recently  lost 1250  diamonds on a glitch purchase ,  I wrote to support for the first time only to be told ""no"", that they will not refund my diamonds! How selfish! I will be extremely  selfish myself as I refuse to spend anymore money here. Insightful!      ","If anyone can tell me how to add the chat feature with guild would be greatly appreciated. game is awesome, normal graphics but not bad for this game. It's easy to understand a bit difficult to figure out how to get things in the very beginning of the game. It can get extremely expensive the more you play, it's very addictive, it could drop it's prices on the in-app purchases then I'd rate it at a 7-8* maybe higher.      ","Support is horrible! I submitted issues a long time ago and when they finally responded, they did not address my issues but instead I read the same ""automated"" message for both of my issues. If you all can't provide proper and good support, why should I keep supporting you?      ","Good, but.. It's a good game but when I level up to level 8 it goes back to level 7 and I have to do everything again, happened 4 times now, can't progress in the game.

Remember why i kept the game on my phone even though i stopped playing.  Haha      ,"WAS good Been playing for months and now that the push reward is about to do some good stuff, the app refuses to work, even after a re-download. Dropping two stars. If it's not fixed, going to taste down to 1. Running off of a Sony Z3 and Sony Z5 on a 1.2 gigabit Internet connection.      ","Very nice game.. Great charachter, and storyline.. I just play it but i want to play it more more and more.. Keep up the good work.. The problem is there are many cut text even use detail (ex: shooting skill, etc), and then please make the data can move to phone and i will 5 star.. And, in extra say that we have 100% chance get rare hero if we finish 20 times hard mode daily dungeon, but when i finish 20 times hard mode daily dungeon i get rare treasure not rare hero becouse who appear is dragon not rare hero.. Please fix it, fix it, fix it..      ","Been wanting to play this after released but then I realize it needs 4.0 ver. So now I got a new phone and BAM! Instant hooked, sure trying to dodge without been hit once is hard but I like the challenge. Game play is smooth. Made with Pati developer who created ILOVEPASTA. Big thumbs up guys keep up the good work.. Edit: Hmm only complaining I have is the grade up of souls and eggs, really? ""Increase as you grade up"", I rather hope not to see 'you'll need 10 eggs for a  a ""single' 6 star hero"". That out of balance. Edit, Run out of requirements before event ends, I was absolutely disappointed, I was so close getting Sain but noooo~ events end right at the time difference. However the game is becoming somewhat dull, you guys have made it perhaps a bit demanding on competitions and 10x effect to gain heroes and gold. Sorry I'm gonna have to give a low star.      ","Best shooting game that got too greedy This game was and still kinda is the best shooting rpg shooting games. The game play is amazing and the graphics is extremely impressive. The real problem comes to the end game. With the addition of limited heros, the game developers got too greedy and made the game ""pay to win"" more expensive than any other I have ever played or seen. Still an amazing game but towards end game, you might lose your interested. This is coming from a gamer who has been playing since the start.      ",A let down At first i am very enjoy with the game..but after a grade up...it became suck...for the second hero grade up..need double material....for differrent hero? Really? U should just make the same amount of material ...why i upgrade other hero and the other hero with same level need to be double material....      ,Not 5-star anymore Been playing for almost a year. It was a good game but recent update made it less uninteresting.  Even worst the app just closed down since yesterday. Tried to reinstall but then get a message error (-111) during patch download. App forced closed just like that.      ,"Must Have This is an awesome game that is very strategic, while being easy enough to pick up and go at the start. Sure they would like you to pay for some things, but you don't ever have to. I've gone quite a ways and put together an awesome team without spending a penny. Great gameplay, nice graphics, and awesome characters.      ",Pretty good Liked it. Would've be better if there's more free to collect stuff.      ,"It had potential. Pros: unique and fun gameplay.                   Cons: arena matching is seriously unbalanced, and auto function is flawed. Goes head first into death, doesnt bother to pick up items and spazes out when a projectile is coming at you from the side.      ","Awesome shooter but... The game's countless sales pop ups can be disengaging. Personally, I have no issue with a free to play model so long as they keep the 'Buy stuff now!' screens to a minimum.      ","Awesome! Sometimes it lags a bit and force closed, but I'm okay with it. THANKS FOR MAKING THIS GAME!      ",Can't download or enter Won't let me download the patch file. Will rate 5 stars once I can play it again. Better not miss free 6 star unit from tomorrow (haloween) though      ,"Paid item I paid for the monthly product where you're suppose to get rubies everyday,  but I'm getting ripped off.

I don't like this game sorry      ,"Finally! I gave five stars. Why? Since it was first launched in computer, I am already playing it. I remember those days, the best miscrits of all time is  Munkee  because of his High Focus and Deep Sleep and that is a massive combo to kill brutally your enemies.

But today, BBS added a new update. It doesn't allow us to use the same abilities twice in a  row. Your reason is to make the battle more competitive and to make miscrits a more strategic game. No, a fact is you've made the game harder, but you've over done it. This would be a good idea if you're starting the game from Zero, but after all what you've done this just blows a lot of things away.      ",Nostalgic!! This game is beast but kindly fix all the lagging since it's a little bit annoying :-)      ,I hope returning users have rewards Ive been playing miscrits for about 5 yrs now. .  im a returning user.

I loved this game and played for 3 years.... and you give us a stupid update?! UGH!! Wth developers fix this now! Oh, and there is a stupid Battle Server Issue I did not have this kind of Issue since the new update! Fix it and I'll rate it 5... You shoud've just nerf all of the miscrits and make it balanced rather than just limit their moves and make it worse.... It was worth 5 stars, but now..... Ugh!      ","Do not download this game if you expect simple things like player support.  There are bugs they will claim are fixed, which aren't.  The email link in the game tells you to use the forums, but their forums are broke so that new people can't post on them.  When emailed again about this, they just ignore you.  Seriously, save your money for a company that actually gives a crap about their players. March 16th Update: So, since you begged for a new rating after the update, how about minus 2 stars?  You claim bug fixes, yet the bugs of ""try again in a minute"", the searching bar staying on screen, and the ""search for miscrit"" and ""click to collect"" bars staying on the screen persist.  You also still have not bothered to respond to bug reports, or fixed the forums so new players can actually post when your Player Support wont accept emails.   The game itself is better than this.  If you had support to equal the gameplay, and actually did bug fixes when you claim you do, this would easily be a 5 star game.

","I love the game, and have played it for MANY years on Facebook. I got Miscrits after I got my new phone that could play it better, and I come to find that move cool downs were added. Definitely not a fan of it AT ALL. The cool downs make the game much more difficult, because for the elementals, the only way to really beat them is by spamming them with stat reducing moves, which is practically impossible to do with the cool downs now. Ruined my experience with Miscrits. Hopefully this changes.

Yes it's a bit repetitive and can be grindy, but overall it feels less amateurish than most. Plus a single $1 purchase removes ads AND gives you gear. That's some real developer generosity.

It takes almost 2 minutes (1min 55sec) from the time you start the app until you reach a screen that you can interact with (minus another star).

And alot of lagging when using holo and cryo grenades, makes your toon run instead of using directional ability. (Minus 1 star) There should also be a better way to get electrum. Grinding away for the full 24 hours on a sector battle and just missing the Commander mark is frustrating and makes it too difficult to get gear to full potential. (Minus 1 star)      ","Biggest disappointment since I found out santa wasn't real To get a lightsaber you have to get to level 100, your character is not a Jedi and isn't force sensitive, it really dosent have that star wars feeling, oh and I almost forgot it requires you to have 2GB of memory in order to play it, if you're looking for a good free star wars game your best bet is galaxy of heros but that's not to good ether really, best bet on hole buy a ps2 and order battlefront 2 haha that's what iv done and I'm really happy      ","Permissions No, you cannot make phone calls.  No you cannot have access to my entire SD card.  No I will not be playing, fine with me.      ","A bit of a grind It's fun at first, but at a certain point it just becomes endless grinding. Doing the same missions over and over to get resources to upgrade equipment.      ","Star Wars - at least Disney & Lucasfilm says so... Story: 3 (you are a smuggler in the Star Wars universe between RoJ and FA, the story arc is okay.  Not great, not bad, okay.)  Gameplay: 2.5 (interface is often wonky, errors occur frequently, force closes happen weekly.)  Freemium: 4 (it's hard but you can complete the game without paying for anything.  But it will take FOREVER.  That's not an exaggeration, end game requirements will force you into direct competition with people who have been playing since launch and you have to rank in Sector Battles for ""Event Crystals"" to meet upgrade requirements.)  Sector Battles: -2 Competing directly against people who have been around so long they have literally every item in the game, is hard.  But to get the advertised Force abilities or Lightsaber you WILL have to compete for event crystals.  Even then, it will take months.  Customer Support: -75 (a team of rabbits weasels with sore teeth would be more friendly and helpful.  They treat you as if you're a liar trying get over on them because their game is perfect.  Of course, when the ""multi award wimming"" game director, their boss, calls people who give harsh feedback a bunch of whiners, what do you expect?)  Pass this game up.      ","It's Great Loved it! The game has everything I looked for organization, beautiful graphics, balanced gameplay (except where the story missions are always a level above you and you can't get instantly to that certain level please fix that I know its a marketing strategy but I just hate that)  and its just wonderful and um one more thing I use to play Spirit Lords and this is a total copy I know its by the same maker but you guys need more creativity otherwise Its great.      ","Update: Was a good little game... Deleting after giving devs time to fix the mess they'd made. Upon the last update, the devs were inundated with serious gameplay issues. Apparently no beta testing used before imposing a game-play  ruining update. I'm pleased a couple issues (not most) had been addressed from their last update, but as a whole gameplay is laggy, costly (time/investment) and PAINFULLY tedious to watch goals/returns  get further and further away.      ","Only game that penalizes you for leveling You have to farm. A lot. Farming gives xp. Xp gives levels. Levels force you to farm more difficult missions before you have upgraded gear to reliably farm previous ones. Also... competative reward system eliminates you if you arent on a good device, before you even try.... the storyline is very giod though. Pretty much the only reason i still put up with the above and slow load times. Those are the worst of any game i have played      ","Typical carrot on a stick Simple progression grinder, nothing special but an adequate time killer. Just do not spend any real money on it, outrageous prices for scant reward, they are essentially pushing pixelated heroin for junkies, relying on impulse buying. Just accept you will not get any where fast in this obvious cash cow and be patient. When South Park did the freemium gaming bit, they were satirising games like this, so fair warning. The controls in this game are really poor, often taps not registering or the character not going to the designated point. That is really the only difficulty i've found in this game, fighting the controls is what makes the game any challenge, and this is not how it should be. The challenge should come from well designed content.      ","Weak and Oversized Gameplay is obnoxious & convoluted. Story drones on without any plot in sight. Visually mediocre. And that's without reaching the multiplayer aspect yet. From what I'm reading in other reviews, I'm glad I never got that far. And it takes up a few gigs of space which could be used for far better things. Forget it. If it wasn't Star Wars, it'd only get 1  .      ","It's a trap! Turns into a job. They dangle the saber in front of you like a carrot and it gets farther and farther away. I've played for months and I wish I never started, it's like a heroin addiction. Once you're invested, they got you. They make nearly impossible missions to get your saber which are endlessly frustrating, and the censors censor everyday words. Gives way too many common items at the premium crane. Real money gets you worthless  garbage. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. SAVE YOURSELF. Fk u Kabam!      ",Awesome So much fun.

In general terms its a good game engine, with a reasonable story line. The grinding does become a bit too tedious though and as you progress through the game a lot of the joy is replaced by pain.............

",Upgrade issue Upgrade components don't show up on upgrade screen even though I have them! Please fix it !!!      ,"Huge potential.. But ruined by the company This game needs to be called what it is a single player semi RPG type game. It has great graphics and a good story and a huge potential that is at every turn squashed by the devs for whatever reason. You can in fact play this entire game without any other player interaction but when it comes to making the final upgrades on gear at high levels you must forefit days of your time to community based sector battles just in the hopes of earning an ""event"" crystal or two for upgrading high level gear. Not an MMO!      ","Good but boring This game use to be good but none everything that you want for upgrades takes a month or two to get 1 and then they change it so now you need 5. Also whats the point of having lightsabers in this game when you have to wait 2-3 years leveling up to lvl 100 and then have nothing that can beat you when you do get it. Month or 2 and then im uninstalling if things dont improve, its just another lucas profit driven thing, like the 2 billion profit from posibbly the worst film yet wasnt enough.      ",Waste of time Downloaded the game and the screen is all scrambled no picture waste of time can someone tell me why in sector battles that after 1 hour the leaderboard has over 2 millions points what type of bullshit is this it's impossible it's a scam don't download no light saber why have a picture of an character holding an lightsaber if we can't get one pure B's      ,"I like the game but.. ..seriously, speed up the load times!

It's really good and easy, I'm totally addicted to it already. Good job, guys!      ",Buggy The game itself is extremely entertaining!  However it is very buggy.  I have spent 600 gems on heroic summons only to have the game freeze.  It spends the gems and gives you nothing in return.  This is very frustrating to say the least.  It also has a tendency to freeze in PvP.      ,"Once great. Not anymore I've been a player for 220 days or so as my count in game states and lately things have taken a downhill turn. It seems like less attention is being paid to the gamers by the developers, less smart content updates like before and a overall lack of any fresh fun ideas. I'm lvl vip 10 for a reason. I used to love this game but now the ""fat on the hog"" mantra that Big Fish/game developers are displaying is sad. - Artimedes      ",Your new update made me start all over again. I would rate this 5 stars but you made me restart the game and I was in level 37.      ,"Great game, but not optimized Great fun game, and you get a lot out of it without having to buy things right away which is a huge plus.

If the game ran smoother it'd be much more enjoyable.      ","fun, but excessive pay to play free play doesn't provide enough currency to keep up with challenge, so you'll end up profoundly underperforming by level 20, unless you spend lots      ",The AI is sometimes extremely bad. It's hard to get really far into the game without paying. Like one hero can be 20 dollars.. However it's a really good game in the beginning and very fun. I like the ideas for the tower and pvp. Needs some balancing changes like the same heroes are used in pvp over and over again. Maybe try adding variety.      ,Big Fun With Little Characters.

This glitch is bad as it says that they are dead but in actual fact are not making them unkillable.

There is some lag every now and then, and in Raids sometimes a character randomly shows up invisible and can't be targeted (you can still damage with ""all enemy"" attacks and status effects). I like the game anyways, though, since Raids aren't a big deal.      ",So awesome  5/5 Really awesome game cool graphics too. But one thing.

Very time consuming but the only problem is that there are issues of the lags and the part in campaign where the enemies are 2 levels higher than my heroes saying that it is really hard gaining some XP... besides that this is a great game I enjoy because it's challenging when it comes to defending your dungeon and leveling up.      ,Fun easy and no bugs I just recently got one of the best charecters well in my opinion but it's easy I have not saw any lag or got any bugs and by far the best rpg I have played plus the graphics are great      ,"Awesome I love it. Great characters, great leveling system. Only thing I wish it had was more options to do things. You got campaign, and raids, and a tower but that's it. Maybe add some other defense or attack levels in there. Other then that this game rocks. I used to play 3 other rpgs like this. Not anymore. All dungeon boss.

Just wanted to throw it out there that this game is unique and unmatched. It is beyond excellent, completely addicting, and super fun! I love the cast of characters and the ability to customise teams for each venture. The effects and gameplay are very high quality for an app game. The game is simple enough that it doesn't take too long to figure out what you are doing. Most rpg-type app games have the problem of over-complexity, yet it is complex enough to not get bored.

I love it because you can play very often, or play casually when real life pokes it's nose in.  Has it's grind like any other game, but it's rewards for the grind seem well placed.  PvP is still bad though currently, it allows for too many unequal fights.  So aside from the flaws, tons to do and very fun!      ",So hard!

I dont care about the rest i spent on it... Masuta Kira, Sifu, & Hansuke are not easy characters to re-earn....      ","Balance is a joke There are 4 or 5 characters that simply dominate everything, and attempting to play without them is at the very least frustratingly difficult. No attempt has been made to balance the heroes whatsoever. PvP is monotonous, as the game has decided who you need to have to win, and anything else you try is simply not going to work. Disgusting.      ","Good waste of time and money Way to many bugs and glitches, the developers idea of fixing thier glitches after you've spent money is a joke.

Very good fun game,But does lag a lil bit,but definitely would be an addicting great fun game      ","That game has a simple system that works quite well. For a moment.   It gets extremely repetitive after you hit lvl50 with your hunter, which is, by the way, the max level for your hunter when your guardians can hit lvl60... (Has nobody noticed that at nhn ? Or are you all just lazy ?) To sum it up, the game goes from dungeon crawling to exp & rune (what you need to evolve your guardians) farming and then, level 50, it's just plain zombie (exp material for your guardians) farming and occasional boss fights...   Another annoying point is the bad level of English that is written all over the app, let me get you an example:  ""freeze souls appears near philly and heavily damages for 10 seconds""  Another example is the developers too stupid to double check their texts for typos, it's been since the daily missions update (1 month or so) that the ""arean"" typo hasn't been corrected.  On the bright side, for a free to play, the paying elements aren't too invasive even though the prices are ridiculous, and don't really block you from getting sick guardians, even though luck has the biggest role here.   In conclusion, not a bad game, but the developing team behind it really needs to step up their game and give it a real fresh breath      ","It's an okay game for it's genre. I've played a number of them in search for one that doesn't become a boring grindfest. But this isn't it unfortunately, as after awhile it does become a grindfest. The AI won't be able to clear anything on it's own, even stages ten levels below it's own level.   And on the subject of AI is the Guardians seem have a bug, I like to believe it's a bug, where they won't attack the enemy and just follow you around even though the enemy is right there and is chasing you. I play primarily as a sorceress, so ranged combat. Happened to me in a boss raid and on stage play.   And then there is the arena/coliseum, which is straight up autoplay with little control from you beyond pick teams and poking their portraits. While yes I use autoplay, it can get really dull watching idiot AIs fight..I know their health is suppose to compensate for their simplistic AI. Maybe I got use to my other game that is also a grind but the AI clears it pretty quick (faster if it's a lower stage) as the AI isn't as stupid and can clear things on their own.

The graphics are good, I like the idea and although waiting for stamina is frustrating sometimes, generally crystals and gold are fairly easy to obtain without spending money. I agree that it now needs more levels and a new section, I would also like to see more options to develop your hunter beyond level 50. Overall very enjoyable though.      ",Not bad The game works perfectly well but then the loading screen takes a while to load. But the graphics on the game is effectively good and  how it runs smooth but to improve on in my opinion is the internet connection when it loses connection which I find difficult to play but the game is good anyways.      ,"Great for killing time So much fun!

This game is an ENDLESS money pit. It is very addictive and the more powerful you are, the more you can play. The most powerful players are the ones that spend a lot of $$ and you never get enough even when you do. Can't even get a new character without spending 100 bucks. It's bs.

IE: I had a choice of several packs for 19.99 I bought one and the other exact same packs are suddenly 49.99. Then it goes to 99.99. So if you want to win events or you're short on patience this game is not for you unless you got money to burn cause the makers seem to think thier stuff is made of platinum. The higher level you get the longer things take talking months. Those packs you see at beginning for low price you will never see again once you buy.      ,Poor service U can't log in the game it stays at 50percent .

Untill you spend another 99.$. And even then it can disappear before you use it.      ",Super expensive no support So you will need to spend thousands of dollars to compete. When the game glitches they always say it's your fault. So if you loose a couple $100 packs in troops because of the game you will not get help. The graphics are bland and never change. It's not worth getting into. If you do decide to try buy someone's else already developed empire.      ,"Better be rich to play this game While this game may be free to play, unless you're just looking for a reason to chat, the scales are tipped heavily in favor of the fortunate. Don't bother downloading this game if you can't handle being completely useless and meaningless, UNLESS you can literally spend hundreds of dollars a month... Literally. Machine Zone appears to care less about player inequality and more about lining their pockets, and it shows. I'll admit, the chat & drama are fun, but i wish i never made friends in this game.      ","There are a lot of ads. In fact, the app is slow to load because of the one that shows when you first start up the game. Aside from that minor issue is the game play, which would be fun if you didn't have to worry about griefing from players with more power. While it is free to download and play, this is very much a pay to win app. Otherwise, progression is very slow for those starting out.

Lately I have not been able to play the game for more than just a minute or two before it crashes, please fix this issue      ","You will loose every time!!! This due to the fact that players who have played this game from the very first are so powerful that they can come wipe you out anytime they please. So, after spending several hundreds if not thousands on this game and to loose all that money in a matter seconds is almost like stealing ng real money from you. I am convinced that this game is controlled by a bunch of immature little thrives that if they decide they don't like you will just simply steal everything from you so you just get upset and quit. DO NOT WASTE TOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME!!!!!      ","Super addictive Good game if you're prepared to pay serious money to even out the playing field. Without spending the money it's not a game of war, but a game of shield, as that is all you will do. Most frustrating part is when they offer a purchase advertised at 90% off but you only actually get 10% of what you would get from a full price pack... How can you do this?! Customer service is non existent, if you ever have a problem... tough!      ",Great game Question. Why is it that my 5th level Dwarf has no skills at all? He doesn't even have a skill menu tree.      ,"Great game but... I'd rather pay for the full game once, instead of being forced to buy chunk by chunk, in reality it gets more expensive than PC or console titles, otherwise well made and fun to play.      ","I like the game BUT I bought this game last night on steam with the DLC pack. I enjoyed it thoroughly and found out there was this app. I bought it and thought that if the was a combined DLC that I could purchase it I would as well because I like the access to the different characters. Instead it looks like I have to buy them all individually as well as the other DLC content. The game is $5 and add at least 21 more on top of that, I just can't bring myself to do it. So I well be paying more on my phone to get the same content.      ","To straight forward I played the game for a few hours and found out very monotonous. Enter dungeon, click on enemies, they die.

Love the game vibe. Takes me back. Highly entertaining if you like levelling.      ,Gets boring after a while There isn't enough variety an after a while it just gets dull. So much so that after completing the first set of quests I have no desire to buy more. Maybe my mistake. Uninstall.      ,"Cloud sync issue I love this game but alas I can no longer play as it just says cloud syncing and does nothing totally unplayable, such a shame.......don't worry I have sorted now, the sync issue is to do with available space      ",Amazing port of one of the best board games ever Please tell me there are more characters and more factions of enemies coming. Possibly multi-player?      ,"Great until level 6 After level 6 the difficulty ramps up to stupid levels.  You will encounter wave after wave of adds until your party wipes or you bail. This happens in every dungeon and if,  as is frequently the case,  your warriors whiff like blind men you haven't got much chance. I love this game but after level 6 there are serious balance issues.  I have most of the DLC and any party combo I've tried has the same result after level 6. I give this game 5 stars until level 6 and 1 star after.      ","Excellent production values, font size issues Still very early, but really good so far.  Only problem at this point is that the font is TINY on my Nexus 7 tablet - almost unreadable.  Haven't found a way to alter that, if it exists.      ",my moneyyyyy after play for a while I discovered that I can't continue further because I need to purchase more map..  wtf...      ,"All about money It is a good game but you have to buy more levels which makes this game very expensive.  Just say its 25 dollars one time, but then it wouldn't sell.  Many other big games you can continue without paying ( clash of clans, sim city etc..).      ",Warhammer quest Really love this game so I spent money! Now it freezes on cloud sync...... Give me my  20.00 back!!!...thanks to sage advice I cleared out some storage space it worked!!!! Back to the war :))      ,Bummer!!! This is a great game but I have just found out that the developer no longer holds the licence so they won't be adding anymore content to it kind of feel I have been ripped off after actually spending money on d.l.c (something I have never done before)      ,"Enjoyed at first, but the undead/vampire DLC will now lock up my game if there are any zombies at the end of combat.  Is there a way to fix this?      ","Loving it! I play the table tops and love the graphics, gameplay, and strategies.   Oh and waaaaa!!  Guess what if you load a pay for play game and have to buy extras in game then don't  cry about.  I purchased  all the extras and they are worth it!!!!      ",Good game This is a lot of fun.

This game is awesome! Not like the other dungeons game! Graphics and UI is good!      ,"True to the tabletop,just wish they would have added multi-player and the ability to name your warriors...would also love to see more classes like the chaos warrior and wardancer.

It is absolutely crazy and ruins the game. The amount of microtransactions the game forces on you to unlock monsters and heroes is also out of this world.      ,"Great game spoilt by microtransactions Really enjoyed this, it's great fun and quite long and with super little graphics. Sadly though after I paid once I didn't want to pay to unlock almost everything in the game and as a result I felt like I missed a lot of content. I dont mind  paying for an app of this quality but repeatedly demanding money just feels like someone just got a bit greedy.      ",Good fun once you got use to it.      ,"More female characters please!   Great game, but where are the women?  My daughter loves this stuff, but she's very disappointed there is only one female character out of , what is it, twelve?   Gaming and comic conventions have about 25% to 40% female attendance now.  How about at least matching those ratios in your game? Or, and this is just me talking crazy here, how about a 50-50 mix of male and female characters?      ","Classic WHQ... for better or worse Just like the classic board game, your warriors will be repeatedly screwed over by unexpected monsters appearing on top of unexpected monsters on top of unexpected monsters.

It would be nice to actually roll dice, like in Talisman, but that is a minor quibble. Great job!      ","Fun, but IAP prices limit my interest. 3 stars for the game itself,  +1 star just because someone finally ported it from iOS to Android (Rodeo had no interest in doing so).  I enjoyed the starting region and would probably keep playing if the additional characters, regions, and dungeons were bundled into discounted packs instead of priced as they are.  As it stands, one character isn't worth the money, and the regions don't look like they add enough new elements to justify their cost, either.  On to something else, I suppose.      ",Good fun There seems to be some kind of bug with this app which causes it to overheat my phone and run down the battery even after I have exited the game. Ended up having to restart my phone this morning to clear it before I lost all power.      ,"1 star because it only gives you 5-6 hours of gaming, after that, you have to buy an expansion (5 ) or repeat the content again. Fun but repetitive game, but for this kind of prices I would play anything else.      ","This game is great (except)  as WITH ALL WARHAMMER GAMES THEY SKREW UP after a short while!!!  I have had to replay old tunnels because my saves don't work!!  I had got my warriors up to a decent standard that took many hours of game play, and when I go back on it, I find that I have lost everything I earned and I'm getting angry,   I paid for this game and I would also spend more to gain more regions,  but why should I, when it keeps going backwards!!!   SORT IT OUT PLEASE,  OR I WILL TELL EVERYONE TO BOYCOTT YOU!!!      ","Nice gameplay, story is okay. Unfortunately I encountered a bug in some quests, where the game freezes, but the contact with chilled mouse was really friendly and customer oriented        ","Great game, except for the bugs Game stuck on home screen ""Syncing Cloud Saves.""

",Fun and works well Only really complaint is paying $2 per character seems a bit high to have options.      ,"High quality game that deserves way more download! Played the free version like a year ago (maybe more) and really liked the game. But there were always some little things that were bugging me, especially the fact that the characters were moving too slow. I guess there was really something special about the game since a year later, I still had that game in my head and just decided to buy the game anyway. Was I ever surprised when I started playing! The characters were now moving fast and the interface itself became more polished. I soon learned that the Trese Brothers were very good at regularly updating the game (even though they've also got newer ones to work on). All my complaints have been solved and what I'm left with is a superbe tactical RPG with intense combat and interesting skill system as well as an interesting story to follow. It's a shame the game is not more recognized.      ",Hero's of Steel Reminds me of old school dark sun games. I love this game and play it every chance I get.      ,"Great TRPG Good variety in skills allows you to set up very unique and differing parties even without purchasing any of the alternative characters. You're nearly constantly fighting nontrash quality enemies, which is what you want to do when you're playing a game. You can always try out the free version to see if it's your cup of tea.      ",Best turn based rpg I downloaded this as soon as it came out and have played several different teams. The story is great and the game play is outstanding.      ,"Best game I own. Period. I've been playing HoS since day one, and after purchasing every new character, have played well over 150 unique and powerful groups using the 8 available characters. Not every group has what it takes, and therein lies the replayability of the game. With every group, you learn what works and what doesn't, improving with every play through. One of my favorite parts of this game is the constant combat- minus backtracking, combat accounts for 75% of the game, and makes for a great experience!      ",Very nice game. They should be making more games like this one.      ,"Well worth the money Great storyline, fun development, and neat class abilities.   A tiny bit slow on my phone, but well worth it.

Visually unimpressive (amateur artwork) but hits all the right notes with a very large underworld to carve your way through,  supported by a passable narrative. Worth supporting. Minus 2 stars for lack of a cloud save option, hours of playtime down the drain with switching to a new device.      ",Reminds me a lot of Shining Force but more involved.

A lot of these other texting apps are lame. But text now is a good one. Some texting apps only allow you to talk with other people who have the same app. And other texting apps have intrusive ads and some of them even have video ads which will gobble up your prepaid minutes.

One of the drawbacks is that if you do not use it within 5 days you lose your phone number. I would give it 5 stars if that we're not the case. I've already lost my number once.

They even give you your own phone number. Keep in mind this will only work when you have the internet connected and that you need to give the new number to anyone in your contacts. You can also tell all your family and friends so they can save money too. No more 100, 75, 50, or 30 dollar phone card! This is truly legit.

I am slowly getting used to emojis being different from the original iphone style you used to have. I would still prefer the original. But a couple of things. I can't send feedback by the feedback button. Also there needs to be a way to link messages sent via group message to each individuals message history. It makes replies very confusing not seeing what message they are replying to. As I can't use the feedback button I can't send any photos to show what I mean.      ,Folder making option disappeared The folder making option used to be there in older version's of this app now it is deleted in 7.0 + versions kindly add it again      ,Too crazy and fluffy I had issues customizing it and being able to read texts and fonts.

Why you can't fix a little bug? If a contact ""Alex"" has prefix ""temp"", it must be displayed under letter A, not letter T. It's not my wish, it is how it MUST work.

I'm not going to give 5 stars unless you fix this.      ","Not responding I don't know why or how, whenever i open it, it'd say line's not responding. Sometimes it works well but mostly it's not responding. Hope to see bug fixes in the next update.      ","Cannot be used on more than one device without deleting the account from the other devices (e.g. phone and table), also no way to use it in a PC - no browser interface and no Linux application. This is a major shortcoming compared to other messengers I tried.      ","Best messenger app I love using Line and vastly prefer it over its competitors Whatsapp and Kakao. In its core functionality, it's not much different considering each of these apps has free voice and video calls and allows you to send photos and videos. However, what distinguishes Line from the rest is its ability to log in using Facebook, it's convenient photo album and note capabilities, it's pleasing aesthetics and finally... Brown and Cony!      ","Audio Bug The video and voice call volume turns up by itself and when put on speaker, the noise switches from speaker to the earpiece. To switch it back, you must plug in headphone jack and pull it out. When a photo/audio app opens, the call drops. Not sure if it's just my phone model (Samsung Galaxy Light T-399) or Androids in general. Also, when both parties turn their camera off it no longer switches to voice call, which is a bit inconvenient. But other than that, the call quality is excellent & stable! Thank You!      ",Customer service is a JOKE. my LINE account got stolen and i  made a new Account. little did i know they look up your accounts by phone number not ID so this hacker has all my photos and will not delete my old account and my line play.. ha that needs to be suspended making me go in circles they need a contact phone number to fix this ASAP      ,"Quality is good but basics need improvement Stop developing features and focus on bugs. Please implement a Busy Tone feature as if a line gets disconnected we can spend two or three minutes on a goose chase, second the loud speaker is buggy, if I press it won't go back to earpiece, same thing happens when you do a video call, if you go back to voice call you can't disable the loud speaker. If someone calls me and press the home button by mistake, the notification disappears and need to wait until they stop ringing to call them back. Basics please.

Only exception is a PC. Cannot handle screen rotation on Samsung Tab S with Android Lollipop + I often cannot hang up after a free call. There is no button to see that I can press. This window is often gone. Always have to ask the other side to hang up then. I was also not able to add a user by searching for his user-id. Nothing at all is shown there. And the worst of all l have a tablet and a phone and according to Line you can't use the same account on both devices. So what now?! Useless app. Can only use 1 device. What a bad joke and unrealistic Line world. In addition the PC app always forgets the login data. VERY Annoying. Now I need it to confirm on my tablet if I logon at my PC. What a scrap if you travel and use Internet shops. Now letter sealing suddenly. Can't read messages again on the PC... What a scrap.      ,Stickers problem Some of the stickers are not showing in sticker display suggestion. I have downloaded all the stickers that are necessary but the problem still remain. It's very inconvenience      ,Motorola Droid Turbo At last! After all my searching and frustration I finally found what I needed. A few months ago I moved to an area bereft of cell phone service even though I am with one of the biggest carriers. We signed up with a cable provider that also provided WiFi. We could assess the internet (messaging) but not make calls. Line lets me use my own telephone number and call wherever I want for a small fee. It's simple to use and has never dropped a call. Just terrific! Thanks!      ,"Got problem after the last update. Each time I want to send something from the chat screen (pictures, videos, etc), a popup is shown telling that line has stopped working. Already restart the phone and the app, I can't try to uninstall it because it got some important chats. Pls fix it :( thanks      ","Last update is a disaster Like many of you I use line for online games. The last update does not just display an onscreen simple notification and tap to disappear. It's not available anymore, only default is now. To press close is causing games to refresh or freeze or just block the screen. During games tap to clear (simple) is essential. Now it will block your view much longer than normal. In the thick of battle it's a disaster, just in typing this I've been held up 10 times. Fix it please. Loss of 4 stars.      ","Current version is crap can't log in How do you update an app and screw up the very basic thing which is user log in?  I followed every prompt when changing device and opened 2 step verification on original device but it still says ,""an error has occurred please try again later"" or, ""invalid phone number"" when I clearly typed in my phone number....this app used to be easy to use But now it's just plain painful.      ","Very popular app Great app for communicating with friends, family or professional contacts. Lots of different ways to communicate including text, video, phone and it's fairly consistent in its operations. As great an app as it is it seems to have poor data dumping functions, which ends up taking a very large part of storage capacity. Moreover, upon manually deleting data the app requires you to sign in and claim that by signing in on your ""new phone"" you must delete all conversations backed up on the server.      ","Marshmallow update After the marshmallow update, I haven't been able to make calls... I'm not sure though. Please fix it      ",Great App Only gripe with this app is it occasionally throws me months back into conversations which takes forever to scroll down to the last comment.      ,Doesn't recognize my address I couldn't even set up an account because it is saying that my address is not valid. We're a new neighborhood but we have been established for over a year. Please update your information.      ,Notifications I have disabled notifications by email and several other options but I still continue to get emails for every response and post that someone makes. If the bug were fixed I would definitely rate the app higher      ,"Landscape View Gone! An excellent app until updates took away landscape view. Why? Now locked portrait in one direction only.

",Good at communications over and over again This is great in concept and mostly on par.  It is just rather clunky and does not give the easiest lay out of what you want to do.

It's great to see the crime reports and have a conversation about how tragic is controlled in the neighborhood. And I didn't expect this, but it's become a resource for finding landscaping work. Also, as it turned out, verification was easy. They sent a postcard and I entered the three digit code when I went to log in.      ","Great, useful tool You'll get out of it what you put into it.

","S5;50mbps;Full Charge From what I've experienced, theres a small glitch where if you scroll down enough, the app resets you to the top or just up. Which then you could just scroll down again, but this happens repeatedly. My guess is that it doesn't buffer enough? So it hides it by moving me up. Also, the reason I installed the app in the first place, was to see how many followers one has by searching them. I've seen it happen before, but now its gone? And if it is, why? Is there a good reason to remove it? Otherwise clean, +4.5      ","Tumblr Ruined my life but hey it's ok, I didn't need one anyways.

","Danged slow on a 3G connection Every time I so much as scroll or rotate the screen, the app decides it has to reload the pictures from the internet. The picture was there on my screen just 200 milliseconds ago. Suddenly you want to get a fresh copy? That refresh time might not be noticeable over Wi-Fi. But at 3G or slower connections that refresh takes 20 to 30 seconds, or more. Meanwhile I'm stuck looking at a blank grey screen. The web page works faster than the app does. Bad app developer, no cookie.      ","It really could be better. I like having an app to access tumblr on my phone and tablet, but it can be horribly unreliable, and crashes in the middle of whatever I'm doing.

Check them. Some time elapses. Get a ""You have 7 new notifications!"" Message. Check them, only to find that there are actually only 2 new notifications because the app thinks the original 5 are still new. The other major problem is B) Images either take way too long to load or never load at all :( please fix this! Thank you!

I am not a fan of the sponsored pins, and if I pin a chicken soup recipe I don't then need 100 pins of the same exact recipe showing on my wall as suggested for me.

I don't know whose idea it was to make the changes that occurred last year, but it was a bad decision on your part to go with it. It seems with every update, more of the users' freedom of choice gets slashed more a d more. Pinterest is losing the originality and uniqueness it used to possess. It's increasingly becoming just like every other unoriginal, mainstream media sharing/social networking app, and I think that's very sad.      ",Very useful but to many updates...

Maybe it'll be an alarm clock next.      ,Prefer the Old Shots to be honest... Still love this app to bits and still use it for selfies. But the update honestly ruined the app the old app was so much more clean and simplistic. Which made it fun to use. Wish you guys added an option to revert back to the Old Shots.

I love g+ but with all theses people with all of there bullsh*t lying and making others thing that that person they hate is bad when they didn't do sh*t. With this some people get very depressed and leave which is smart because most people don't like being depressed. On g+ most people get so depressed they get to the point of killing themselves!

A clean, easy to setup and use app... Enough said.      ",Nice Apps Please provide facility for email  reminder for daily/weekly/monthly or time customize like other compitative apps.      ,"Interesting, but dated looking mail app Has plenty of good security features, but the actual app looks seriously out of date prevents me from jumping onto the paid version and away from the other paid apps out there.      ","Email part works fine, but I cannot figure out how to import my current keys. The import function in My Secure Phone does not see them. That lowers the rating since I cannot seem to use my existing keys.  The other reason I am giving it a 1 is because there is no support. I emailed support two days ago and have not received any response at all. No support, plus non-working UI means low rating.

This is not specific to device, O/S, Exchange version.... the only thing constant is the Secure Mail client.  In fairness, if this was fixed it would be a decent app      ","Great app, but Hotmail Sync Problem One of the trustworthy e-mail clients I've ever used on my device(s), been using it since the past 2.5 years and it never failed me. The syncing is spot-on, and the resources consumed is comparatively less when compared with default e-mail clients present on the device(s), or other apps that I've used.  Only con that I've encountered so far is that Hotmail/Office 365 account isn't synced efficiently, perhaps a problem on the Microsoft side. Will check the exchange server 30 day trail and add in more points.

Uses too much battery compared to other email apps with similar account settings. Still some minor bugs.      ",So far so good The app lives up to its potential. I like the idea of  being able to successfully use all emails with our an issue is a nice change. If You could use this to by pass mms issues like those with lolipop for android and cricket wireless. This would get 5 stars      ,The Real Deal! Only one thing I wish they can fix and that is for all messages to properly fit the screen. Many messages actuality do but for some you have to manually adjut them which is time consuming.

Thank you!      ,Great secure device app      ,Good client...      ,Pretty good app.      ,Almost good Performs S/Mime at a high price. DJIGZO is an alternative. Nice interface. Has altered the identities from k9 to unusable (needs mail address not just reply address).Would definately use the app if digitally signing an email using S/Mime was cheaper and Identities worked...      ,"It WAS a very good mail app, but I can no longer click on hyperlinks in email to go to the url & I have not been able to get any response from the developer about the issue.      ",Great app I like all its features and the user friendliness of the interface. Seems to have sync issues from time to time but I could be wrong. I would love to see more security options. For the name you should offer much more than buying an SSL certificate. Overall great app.      ,Great email for exchange Its great it pushes.   It searches it send large files I use it a lot and I bought it for my two cheap tablets.  Digiland and hipstreet which is on the licensing but for some reason it added a new tablet I never owned so now I have to buy a new license if they don't fix but the proggie itself is worth the purchase      ,"Your app is really great but i would like a ""mark / unmark all"" and sellect only the used providers to be shown! Consider this for the next update.      ",Is missing exchange server provider. Unfortunately I can't use it.      ,Ads and constantly logs you out of your accounts...

Hard to setup other email. Doesn't like to let you exit. Hard to delete, sometimes will delete, sometimes not. Don't use this app.      ","Needs a repair The longer you use it, the slower the 'self - populating' email address function works. It's like a cache is too full but can't be emptied. I have to unistall/reinstall to get the app to work,  pita!  I'd give this app a five if they would resolve the issue.

I missed important emails, the same works fine with gmail app.      ",Great app. I like the way I can combine my inboxes. The conversation view is also great. Better than the Gmail app that keeps crashing.  Easier to configure than the Microsoft Outlook app.  Would like to see integrated calendar.      ,"I wanted to love Mailwise. I really did. It's got a clean, easy-to-use interface, and is nicely responsive. But there's a fundamental flaw.  Unlike any other mail app I've used (stock, K-9, BlueMail, others) Mailwise cannot manage to sync my Sent and Trash folders with my IMAP folders or map them from the app, so I can't read my Sent & Trash from other devices. This may be a problem specific to my setup with Bluehost mail servers and your mileage may vary, but for me, it's a fatal flaw.  I tried for over a month to get this sorted out with the developer, but they've been pretty sporadic in responding and have not provided a solution. If I could get this issue taken care of, I'd probably jump to 5 stars...      ","Unfortunately as an IT System Admin I must rank 1 star Allowing users to bypass exchange rule enforcement is an extremely large security risk. While the app itself is great, I have been forced to block it in our environment as the ability to do so breaks the contract signed by employees when they start. Many of them do not understand this and view it as protection against a remote wipe by our company (only used in terminations during which the ex employee refuses to remove the account with a staff member present). Government information is strictly safeguarded.      ","STILL no unread count on icon on S5 Edit: New update and still the same thing.  Mailwise addressed my other issues and they appear to have been resolved.  However, I still am getting no unread count on the app icon on my S5 even though the box is checked.  Works fine on my S4 mini though.      ",Quiet time needs work Can quiet times stop all notifications? On the weekend I don't want to be reminded of work!      ,Excellent app! Consistently quick and trouble free.  Wish I could delete the 'Sent from MailWise' signature on the free version though.      ,Great corporate email client This is exactly the email app I was looking for. It has what I need and more.  It has great integration with Exchange this is a must for corporate email and the clutter free way of presenting email is just spectacular.  Mailwise team has done a great job with this app and there support team is very eager to provide support via Google plus communities.      ,"Great Everything works well. Only issue is when switching phones/reinstalling the app. It doesn't always reinstate my pro version. Either given enough time and forcing update to the active feature  codes, or contacting support solves the issue.      ",Great app! I've never been closer to the empty inbox then when I'm using this program.

I take it down to 4 stars though because they do not have IMAP push support. This app only has push support for exchange accounts.      ",Very pleased Tried others.

I don't see point of monogram dots & pics of senders.  The number of emails missed or lost among the bundles is ridiculous. I just need my emails delivered in a professional manner, in order, & easily accessible. I like the basic simplicity of Android's Mail app - all accts under one roof, clean & to the point. Inbox is not for me. Shopping for a cleaner, more inclusive email app.      ","Simply the best, for Gmail. As others have said, this the best email app out there. Incredibly simple, intuitive, and beautifully designed, inbox truly does keep everything very well organized. I love how it seamlessly works with and imcorperates your calendar, and how it intergrates easy done and snooze gestures. This app is a work horse for my primary Gmail account, and I can't go back to the old way now. The only downside is that I can't use Inbox with my other IMAP and exchange accounts.      ","Love the features, but struggle with notifications I've been using Inbox for almost two years and really love it. Recently it's begum crashing whenever I open certain emails and that's very annoying. Otherwise, great app.      ",Impresive. Superb. A Marvel. Ingenious.  Powerful & Smart E-mail Organizer App. FULL FIVE STARS.      ,"Inbox of the Future As with most Google apps these days, inbox offers an intuitive system that makes basic, mundane activities feel streamlined and easy. This is simply the best email app I've used thus far.      ",Suggestion after 1 year of heavy usage Do integrate with Google calendar in your next update.      ,"No connection on Mobile data On network data the app doesn't get the emails: shows ""No connection"". I've lost valuable updates because of this.      ","Should be better Where's the forward all button? And why the option in settings to have only the bin button OR the archive (done) button, IE it's not possible to have both, is unnecessarily limiting.      ","Signature Setting(s) Talk a out senseless and a major oversight. This app gives option of signature, but add it's BELOW the entire thread. So if a thread is long, at the very bottom all you see is a repetitive list of your signature. It's absolutely a joke. So unprofessional. FIX THIS      ",Inbox gmail Really starting to like the inbox by Gmail stacking all your mail in one spot works better for me      ,"The best I think it's the best personal email. Don't know if it's good for work too, but for personal purposes is perfect.      ",There's still some functionality missing (mostly different signatures for each mail address) that prevents Inbox from becoming my sole email client - but it's already perfect for most email-related tasks other than actually writing them.  Reading mails and snoozing those that don't need immediate attention works like a charm.      ,Multiple email accounts I love to use inbox but missing the multiple email accounts / exchange accounts setup...hence 3 stars only      ,"Room for improvement It needs a little more thought into integration with both keep and Google now. Usually triggers on all, but keep doesn't always attach to it.      ","Snooze settings are way off. It tries to guess the best ones for me but they are always way too far in the future. For instance, in the morning I don't have a ""this afternoon"" setting but a next day, next week etc. Please let me choose what I want!

Stuck with K-9 for a few months but gave up waiting for UI improvements and I could never get notification badges to work properly (S6 Edge). Outlook isn't bad, but MS has alienated me recently with ""you need a Microsoft account"" for everything under the sun. No thanks.  Installed Aqua and then purchased the second day. I have no issues with dev's getting compensated for their work.If you cant afford $6.00 then use a free one.  Just a pet peeve here...Why oh WHY do people complain about paying for an app? Is someone holding a gun to your head and FORCING you to purchase it? Just move on man, nobody cares why you don't want to pay for it.  Aqua is very feature rich and has a pleasant UI which does not look dated and stuck in the 90's. Pretty much everything has customization.   I also REALLY like the font options, re: sizing, bold, underlining and so forth. Very similar to a Word toolbar, and it works even for setting a sig. You can also insert and re-size images very easily.  So all in all, a very solid email client.      ","Great features, fantastic support Recent support from dev is best I've ever experienced on Android. Incredible number of settings & features available in a somewhat complex, but well organized structure. If you're having problems with a specific function, there's probably a setting for that. The ui is, imho, elegantly implemented.  Dev is actively developing additional features, and as hinted, fixes stuff asap. Well worth Pro$. .. Please ditch the stupid FAB (floating action button).      ","I would have liked it but. .. This app would be awesome except for one thing. ..It will only allow you to add two accounts, any more and you have to pay to unlock it. Bugger that, there are plenty of email apps out there that are just as good and let you use more than two accounts for FREE. I just can't bring myself to pay for an email app, sorry dev. Nice effort but I wish I had have known the limitations before I installed and set it up. Now uninstalling.      ",Great app! Well done! It will be better if it has the function:    SET EMAILS TO LATER - Quickly mark emails to be handled later and set reminders so user do not miss them.      ,"I was happy, then I realized the promo signature... :( to prominent for a ""free version"" app. the app though is fast, well designed and pretty clever. I preferred it over cloudmail, k9mail, gmail, bluemail amm. BUT I  also think 7 dollars is really expensive to remove the annoying promo signature.  Why you don't use in app ads?  cheers anyway.      ","One of the best. It's been over a year since I first tried this app so I thought about giving it another shot and it STILL can't see my custom folders in yahoo. Is that so hard to accomplish?! Edit: bug solved, now almost perfect app.      ","Now that AquaMail has threaded conversations, I'll never look at another email app again. I've tried at least 8 email apps on Android, and AquaMail has the following advantages (off the top of my head): - Fantastic vertical split-screen handling - Tons of customization - Ability to NOT stay on in the background listening for push (if, like me, you'd rather only check mail while the app is running) - Really clear and simple handling of multiple accounts (fewer steps to switch between accounts than other apps) - Great compose UI - Doesn't sync secondary folders unless you say so - Full screen option - Easy, obvious access to reply, reply all, fwd, etc in the message viewer - You watch messages arrive when checking mail, instead of waiting for the polling to end, then waiting for all the messages to render in bulk like some other apps - Complete control of font sizes in all views - and the list goes on.

",Disappointed Used to give 4 stars but there's no way to edit my social media connections so I'm uninstalling      ,"No good anymore! This app never should have been given up by White pages! It used to actually be good! The settings options suck now! It took me forever to find an app like this that I truly liked and now ""Hiya"" has ruined it!

Slower overall performance than when it was white pages caller ID      ,"Change Wish some type of warning went out before changing Co. Name... I didn't recognize this app and erased the app along with all my blocked numbers, text messages and settings. Now I have to start over...      ",Very intrusive. Well I like the features of the app whenever a call comes in it blocks so much of the screen it becomes a real pain in the butt. And it won't go away unless you click on something and sometimes you try to answer a call after the 4th or 5th ring you're just trying to get to the phone and that stupid logo blocks the screen.      ,"Great app Great app for blocking spam and scam calls, and identifying unknown callers. Would be 5 stars if it blocked toll free calls as well.      ","This is a great app.  Why only 4 stars?  If there is a way to prevent spam/blocked callers from being able to leave voice mails, then this would be worth 6 stars.  Right now, the spam is marked and I can block it, which is great.  But then I still have to clean out my voice mail of spam messages.      ",The best app ever!!! I love it and it automatically blocks scam calls and telemarketers... Thank you soooo much. I even get to block who I want too...      ,"The new caller ID is positioned DIRECTLY over my phone icon that needs to be accessible to accept or reject a phone call.

I marked a call as a telemarketer and there was no confirmation that my note was actually applied. After I blocked it, then I saw my note.  I'm not happy with the Hiya replacement at all. Uninstalling.      ",It's kool So one day it's white pages the next it's Hiya?? I don't remember agreeing to this. Plus some features aren't on this that were on whitepages like pick up hang up for instance. I now have to constantly empty my voicemail due to spam and telemarketers. The old version was just fine with me.      ,"Has slowed down considerably *Update* since the update and name change from Whitepages it has really slowed down. Not as nice looking or as user friendly anymore.The option to pickup and hangup on blocked callers isn't there anymore. This app worked very well, stopping a lot of unwanted calls. It doesn't block private or anonymous calls from voicemail. I don't want someone using *67 and getting to my voice mail. Not as good as it was.      ","Great App Great app, saved me a lot of frustration and time. Everything works awesome! Love the call blocking for telemarketers and spammers. Highly recommend :)      ",Stress free app. I've been plagued  with scam after scam on my phone.this app.filters the crap.thank you      ,"Good, not great Works pretty good most of the time.  It occasionally fails to block a number that is already flagged as a  telemarketer in their database.  Also it does not really block the call, it sends it to voicemail.  Would prefer a pickup/hangup option.      ","Truly works! I've gotten so many scam/ telemarketers after getting a new number , that I  began to research  several apps to  block the  calls. This not only blocks them, but also gives the  name of the company.      ",Takes too long to load the caller list The new colors are very vibrant and the app still works well.  But many times it takes FOREVER (several minutes) to load the caller list.      ,Love the new name. It's a must have app for Android phones. It identifies almost all callers - businesses and users. The scam protection features are awesome - you can set it to auto-block all nuisance calls. If you have elderly family/friends - install this app on their devices since they tend to be target for scammers.      ,No longer works.  It used to allow me to choose whether to send blocked callers to voice mail or to just hang up on them.  I chose hang up for all spam.  That is no longer an option.  It does not save me time if I have to check my voice mail to delete the spam.      ,"Mr Number I am a cab driver that answers my own calls. I was getting a lot of non customer calls...Mr Number has  id'd all but one that slipped thru today, so I added it, it even id'd my provider, (sprint) as a scam...yep its works great.

Poor app. Can't distinguish between a restricted number and an unknown number. My phone can tell the difference, why can't the app? Also, continues to label perfectly good callers as spam.  Mr. Number, with just a little tweaking, this could be a great app. This is NOT an older version. I have the current version. Problems still not fixed.      ","Great App...Love it! Miss the options of hanging up or sending to voicenmail. Also, the ability to ignore all private callers. I do wish there was a way to add numbers you want to keep from the list directly.      ",Dpdolphin This app is great. Does a lot of things that I have not learned yet. I just got it recently for blocking numbers but am learning that it has a lot of features I am going to enjoy down the road.

Excellent when you another line and want to keep your primary # more private. Ps. You can block unwanted calls.      ,Love It!!! This application does exactly what it says. Love how everything is just a button away from blocking all types of calls. I'll recommend to anyone who gets solicited calls.      ,"Great!

Installed this and its no longer a problem.      ,ABSOLUTELY love it! Finally found the option to auto hang up. Every other block app sends calls to VM automatically. Which sucks. Great APP      ,Note 5 Use to be a good app. Now all the blocked calls I had go to voicemail?  That defeats the whole purpose of this app. Thanks for making a perfect app to the worst app. It use to hang up why can't it do it again?  IF YOU WANT A APP THAT ACTUALLY BLOCKA CALLS DO NOT GET THIS ONE.      ,Excellent if you don't like to waste time talking to time vampires such as telemarketers. Just make sure if you use a battery savings app that you disable this program from stopping otherwise the spam calls will get through. I mainly use it to stop harassment from spammer that have called me before however the program is linked to a database of perhaps millions of spam phone numbers and you can even go on there enter in the phone number and leave your own comment about the nature of the call and add to their already vast list of spam numbers. I highly recommend this app to anyone who has a business with a presence online.      ,Perfect Sends unwanted calls straight to voicemail so I don't have to answer and they have the option of leaving a message if it's something important.      ,"Very Unhappy I'm very unhappy with the updates smh I thought updates were suppose to make apps better not worse! Since all the updates I can no longer block texts. I can't individually choose whether I want to send the blocked caller to voice mail or hang up, and when a blocked number calls it still rings several times before going to voice mail! Which kinda renders this app useless. What a shame because I used to love this app!      ","Mr. Number Blocks calls, spam, and dangerous numbers. Informs you of numbers that are unrecognizable! Well worth it! This app is easy to use and does everything it is suppose to do. I love it!      ","Best app for unsolicited calls! I am never bothered with unwanted calls and when a number I don't recognize pops up, the app let's me know who it might be so I can decide to ignore or accept. One of the best apps I use!      ","Update: Battery draw seems fairly low.  I occasionally have trouble submitting Spam reports, it simply says ""Please try again later"" - which is rather meaningless.  Seems to work fairly well.  Recent Calls listing is slow to refresh, and it auto-refreshes so that adds perceived sluggishness.  It would be helpful to offer a filter/switch so that Recent Calls would show only incoming - I don't need to review outgoing calls all the time so pls allow me to control that.      ",The most used app on my phone! I love having the ability to block unwanted phone calls. I just wish it blocked as soon as the number tries to come through disturbing my day. Otherwise awesome app      ,"Call blocking is only partial It does an ok job at keeping the phone from ringing for most unwanted calls, but they are still able to fill up my voice mail with spam. Not a complete solution.      ","It works pretty good Some things get through the cracks, but overall this app works really well      ",Samsung S3 Doing a really poor job of hanging up on callers. Most of the time they're still able to leave a voicemail. Very frustrating. I'll be looking for a better app.      ,"I really like this app,  I have it on both my phones.  Just wish that when block calls come in that Mr Number  would show the company and number.  For ALL calls not just mark it as spam mainly when it's a new number I haven't seen.  But all in all I like this app.      ",Love it...or not... Best blocking app I've ever used!! **Update: So many blocked numbers get thru! Very annoying. What is the point of the app?! Seems it used to be better.      ,Worst app ever! Downloaded it blocked one number and it still came through. Not happy with the app. Only have one blocked number added. It will not block the call or text. All it does is eat up memory on my phone. Worthless app!!      ,"Great app I have been using this app for about a week and it is amazing. It automatically blocks known spam calls without me having to enter the number. Occasionally, a few calls slip through but it has been many at all. I would recommend this app for others to use if you are getting spam calls constantly.      ","Al-Sabah Time waist! It didn't revealed unknown number.

Only drawback here, the app can be a little intrusive, cover your current screen with pop-up windows that are cruelly lacking a close button (that is just the UI designer in me talking) and it kinda drains battery if you don't force stop it now and then.

The phone already knows what the number is, if you can't tell me who it is this is storage that I can use for music I won't listen to.      ","Unimpressive! To start with, this app has failed to identify even easily identifiable call numbers, like those of a large British auction company or a personal number in the public white pages. I Googled and ID-d them in five seconds. How on earth can the devs claim to be able to catch spam calls, then? It's useless, guys. Must be a US-only app!

BUT it locks the phone during the call so you can't do nothing else(back/home and menu buttons do not work). I'm using GPS app on my phone 99% of the time and if someone calls me - I lost the map for the duration of the call. The app not recognizing if the call was answered by headset - there is still answer the call button on the screen. And if I have to use a dialpad during the call - there is bunch of steps to it.      ,No write up! I can't see what I type on the app. All fonts are blank when I try to type search any contact. Very upsetting!      ,"Samsung Galaxy Like it, but needs more screen choices, doesn't sync well on my phone. Can be glitchy but overall I like it.

Is there a way to do this?      ,Needs more features but still worth the purchase..

But it's not        ,"Great app, but crashed to many times, however I still like it Very good app, but I wish it didn't  crash so much. It might be due to low space on my phone.

Every time  I  add a clip, the  music  stops  working  please  fix      ","Like this app, use alot alot but... Please put in a video clip volume adjustment..... Please!

Won't let me select files Just updated the app and it STILL won't let me select video files!! I paid for the Pro version and every time I try to select a video to edit, I get an error message of ""Unsupported File."" I've emailed the developer with no response. Took my money for a product that doesn't work. LG G4. I've sent example video already.      ","It could be better if it has full HD. The App. is better then I thought, Its easyer to use. But it does not have a full HD1080p. I have a full HD video 1080p , after it process it the quality of video is half hd 720p. Maybe they designed it just for mobile phones only.

There's no way to share draft videos across devices. Very disappointing finish to an otherwise great app. Check your device before spending too much time editing a video.      ",Don't change just enhance! Made my first video and it was so fast. Maybe it's my new phone. I enjoyed all of the features and it's simple.

I could create a nice video with this and now i am stuck. If you could give me a solution then i will give 5 star      ","Love it I dont see any problems, honstly this one is better then the viva video that is free I think you should just buy the app, and if you do buy it I promise you you'll fall in love  with this app as well      ","WHOEVER MADE THIS APP- HELP ME ASAP NOW I was using this for a recording when I went over 5 min. I bought the full app but it said that the video loading failed when I had great wifi. This is a group project for school and I definitely don't want it to be deleted. PLEASE. WHOEVER MADE THIS APP, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE CONTACT ME TODAY OR AT LEAST TOMORROW OR ELSE I'LL GET A REFUND. NOW PLEASE!!!!!      ","5 Star Goodness! Wow! I have to admit, this might be the most best editor I have ever came across to! I just made a short Diet Dr. Pepper commercial with it! Thanks, VivaVideo!

Uploaded a video to YouTube and the quality came out at 360 and not in the 1080 HD that I recorded in. I thought the paid version would let you do that.      ","Worth it Very user friendly and easy to pickup. Tried another Video editor that that fell under the ""Editor's Choice"" and I must say this app far surpasses the other in my view. 5min limit w/o But you gain unlimited for purchasing. I bought it simply because I was impressed with the time I spent using this app. Nicely done 5/5 LG G3      ",Does not work with Android. Does not run or load at all. Customer service has not responded. Don't waste your time or money.      ,"Liked editor videos by iSpartaFujitec It's really liked the ""VivaVideo""... Just is replace the video editor is: Cute CUT. Because in Android can't editing video use Cute CUT, only in iOS. Android only editing video on VivaVideo.      ","Really great I really like how I can import multiple clips with such ease. All the effects are really great. The only bad thing is the sizing. If u could make it full screen, then i would give it 5 stars      ","Video Quality is Poop Good for simple videos like vlogs which require minimal editing, not good for voice-overs to cover up jump cuts however, (choppy transition going from clip to clip) and when adding music it fades the music at the end with no option to turn that fading off. But, the biggest issue: you guys need to improve this app by allowing HighER Definition than 1080x720! This is soon important, cause even at 1080x720, when you upload it to YouTube the quality goes down.      ","Worst app I ever used, doesn't work and no response after 3 emails This app doesn't even work, unsupported on both paid and unpaid version, Android video worked first time, tires to contact these guys for help numerous times with no response, will Uninstall and spread the word on my forums how horrible it is, what a joke.      ","Great video editing app for android Great video editing app. Moved to this once Google auto movie wasn't compatible with my one plus one. I don't need all the cutesy themes and speech bubbles and  wish it had better music choices or easier to add your own music. But overall, easy to use, and share. Get the pro version..worth the price.      ",Love it overall! A one of a kind app. Not much if anything that covers as much stuff in one app. The only thing I think would be a cool addition would be the support for slow motion videos and a finer tuning slow motion editor.      ,Still the best! Stop complaing that you bought the pro version. Send them an email that you paid for it and they will send you a code to get this app ad free. Do it! Do it!      ,"Disappointed I had the paid app for years and loved it took this new version,  now it doesn't have a search engine and I'm lost.  Anybody have the Web address for their torrent search engine? ?? Not to mention I had to pay for it twice! !! And I did send email,  Google play only sends them a limited# of ""coupons""!

I recommend it to all android users!!      ,"great torrent apps after the update there is little change in the search settings, updates the previously easy and smoothly to find any torrent file but not anymore. and the new update that is why I must to pay again? but it's okay,, because the application is very helpful, and the price is not too high .. and this tTorrent is very faster to download any file.. Thank You..      ","Great app First I would like to say thanks for the voucher code I'm glad to have the ad free version once again, the support team dealt with my claim to get back what I had already paid for promptly. I never used the in app search to start with so it was not missed but I would like to ask if you could shorten the app name, I don't think the ""(no ads)"" bit on the end is really needed. No big deal if it's kept but food for thought.      ",Terrible app. If I could give less than 1 star I would. So many other torrent apps better than this. Do not waste your time and $$$.      ,Still awesome. Still 5 stars -- not the developer's fault Google blacklisted a supported plugin.  Is it really that horrible to do without half a cup of coffee to remove the ads again?      ,Emailed them and got my purchase back Almost got worried. Thankfully they emailed me a purchase code. Back on pro version.      ,Good support As a pro owner got a code for this as free version after contacting they support.      ,Very good application People are complaining and giving one star because the search function was removed. That's unfair. Everyone who cares to read the change log knows exactly what happened. It is still the best torrent application with a lot of features.      ,Well had to pay again Had to pay again and it still doesn't work Smh.      ,"Thanks for everything It still is easy as ever to search for your own torrents and use this program, so don't be upset they took out the search feature.. Not their fault, be mad at Google.. As it violated one of their play store rules.. Folks should read more before they complain. And thanks, got my ad free version no problem from support after I emailed them. Still rating this five stars for their continued efforts after the fact.      ",Wish I didn't have to pay again But it's a good app.      ,Weeks gone by and and still cant use this app. Please hurry up with a patch to fix      ,"Nothing like buying it a 2nd time I would rate higher, but since I had to buy it a second time that's as high as I can rate it.      ",Disappointed Have been a loyal user for years. Disappointed by the disappearance of the search engine. That's one thing that set ttorrent apart from all the other clients.      ,File is too short error still best app File is too short error still best app      ,"Still a good app Paid for pro, I think paying again won't hurt. They put a lot of effort into it, however the voucher is great. I hope the little amount paying for it again helps them keep up the good work.      ",I never used the Transdroid search option. So I have no regrets.      ,"Best Torrent client on Android Looks like they've deprecated Ttorrent Pro.  Like the other reviewers said, shoot them and email and they'll give you a code for this version.  Thank you so much!

Google forced them to remove it. It's still an excellent torrent client. Keep it up!      ,"Great app, blame Google This is a great app. But Google found that their search feature violate some of their terms. And removed their pro app from the play store. They have no choice but to relist this. I'll support nonetheless. All the best      ","No longer the best, its a shame Got tired of Flud fragmentation I decided to go back to tTorrent after 2 months. Straightly bought the paid version cos the free one was good. But instead I found out that search is gone. Malicious? No. Illegal, maybe. Just maybe, depends on what engine and what is being searched. Just like warez on Google Search. So if no pressure from G, please reconsider, or let us install the plugin if we wish. I dont want to refund cos this app was good, and I want to support it, I'm surprised it only got 1k downloads.      ",Excellent Unfortunate that I have to pay again but I'm happy to support an excellent product from an excellent developer. They have a good reason to charge again and the price is more than reasonable. It's a great quality app and rating it 1 star because you had to pay again is not cool.      ,Still Great As Ever It's a pity that one of the best torrent apps is getting all these bad reviews because of some circumstances beyond the developer's control. This can be so misleading! It's still as good as ever despite having to take out the search function in order to comply with Google's policy. No problem paying for it again given that the new price is so affordable.      ,Where's the search You guys have made a great app and I didn't mind paying it again. But you got to figure how to make search again? It is but useless without search.      ,It's still a good app If you want the search engine with the app then don't download from the playstore. Go to the website and download the old ttorrent pro      ,App works perfectly with all the settings I need/want (with the exception of saving to SMB/FTP network share). -1 star for having to pay again with no warning or reason.      ,"User of ttorrent pro Well, this is without search function. And why you don't make it transfered pro account to this one, so i dont buy again. Btw, very good bt app.      ",Not working Great app until now... I Never pay for apps and this one i actually paid for and it doesnt work. Help! CAN NOT SEARCH      ,"Best torrent app without a doubt I was bummed to wake up and have this app removed from my phone. After all, being a paid user I was stumped. Not super stoked to pay again, but this app is a must and I have no problem spending .99 . Thanks for getting it back up as fast as you did.      ","Reason search part is gone Bad news, today I have received an email from the Play Store support: Hi Developers at tagsoft  After review, tTorrent Pro - Torrent Client, hu.tagsoft.ttorrent.pro, has been suspended and removed from Google Play as a policy strike because it violates the malicious behavior policy.

I wasn't really a podcast addict when i first downloaded this app.  But now I am hardcore. I blame the creator of this app. I started out on the free version, then I had to get the paid version.  Now I'm hooked. And i don't think they have a 12 step program for podcast addicts.      ",Addicted to Podcast Addict!!! I have been using Podcast Addict for years now. I love it. Period. The makers deserve to have a few of my bucks for the endless enjoyment I get from their app. Thanks for this great program!      ,"Problem fixed!

Thank God it was really annoying redownloading podcasts      ","Nothing Else Will Do After using the free app for a couple of years, I decided to venture out to check out the competition.  I even bought a competitor's app. Guess what? Came running back!   Podcast Addict is just a better total package and offers more functionality in the free version than most paid apps of competitors. Figured I'd pony up the $3 to credit the devs for turning me into an addict ha-ha!      ",Great podcast software I've used this app nearly everyday for over a year. It does everything you'd expect and more. Very reliable.  One piece of feedback or feature I'd like to have is an easier way to add tracks to the playlist. I like to listen to my podcasts while out walking so a way of queueing them up easier would be appreciated.  Keep up the good work.      ,Best Podcast App This is the best Podcast app on Android. Never crashes and easy to use. It's definitely worth the $2.99 to donate and get rid of those pesky ads.      ,"Long time Podcast Addict user, finally had to support the creator.

After horrific experiences with two other paid apps, I was delighted to find an app that can be fully tried out for free, is fully functional, seems to work, and, most importantly, HAS A RESPONSIVE DEVELOPER!

Works great, has all my podcasts in one place and is always being updated and tweaked for the better... well it, here have $10 which is what I'll be donating right now :)      ","Best podcast app, no doubt. Use it every day, well worth the small donation.  One request; could you make it possible to favourite a podcast from the playlist. This would save me time searching back through a long list of podcasts if I decide to remove a podcast from the playlist that I haven't listened to but wish to at a later date. Thanks.                                                 Thanks for the response but it doesn't help because I won't to favourite from the playlist.      ","I've used a couple podcast apps. This one comprehensive podcast app does everything you need and is easy to use. There are a couple of UI choices that could be improved, but by and large this app is great. I was using the free version for a few months and it was such a good value upgrading to the paid version was an easy decision. I've been using it for a little over a year now and it's simply the best. I highly recommend using either.      ",Good app **UPDATE**  info from developer worked.

","this is THE podcast app to get!  i've tried many others.  ton of functionality.  support is best ever.  prompt and helpful.  new features constantly being added based on customer feedback.  only minor quibble is that it can be difficult to navigate all the menus at first, but that's a side effect of all the functionality being supported here.  i wouldn't know how to better organize the menus myself.  now that i've used the app for a while i no longer have any problems navigating the menus.      ","Xavier, the developer is the best! Answers emails FAST and makes sure the problem is solved. The app is hands down the best podcast catcher app, but you know that already.      ","Great app better Dev Posted a review of the free version with a problem I was having downloading new episodes of a newly added podcast . Dev responded right away. I started an email exchange with him on a Saturday and he was all over it trying to help me fix what very well could be user error. Amazing response time, care and customer support for a non-paying user . I had no problem with the ads, but wanted to do more than just say ""thank you"" for him going the extra mile to make my experience the best it could be.      ",Addicted This app is great! Keeps my podcasts up to date and organized. Faster listening speed saves me time. Keep up the good work.      ,"I used this app for an embarrassing amount of months before donating. What was I thinking?? It's intuitive, never crashes, and gives me seamless access to any podcast i could imagine. I guess it is easy to take the brilliant things for granted. Thank you Xavier. You write excellent code, my friend.      ","Essential for podcasts Some apps are so good that you wonder how you coped with anything else. This app is one of them. It is feature-packed but not bloated, with in-built RSS support (great for podcasts that provide blog posts to accompany episodes) and practically allows you to customise how customised you want your feeds to be - do they all download only to the last 5 episodes while on Wi-Fi, or can this or that podcast download up to 10 even on cellular, and so on. I came for the SD card support, but stayed for the great app.      ",There is no better podcast app Trust me this is the best podcast app but there are a few problems with chromecasting and it would be nice if this app was more organized and PLEASE ADD more material design transitions & MAKE EVERYTHING SMOOTHER. Otherwise this podcast app is basically perfect      ,My favorite! I tried dozens of podcast apps and out of frustration I kept using my mp3 player instead of just my phone. I had a wire nest too! Now I have only my phone because I can listen to my podcasts my way! The mp3 player and other apps are outta here!      ,"Best podcast app I've used on android Just donated to help support, the ads Arnt bad at all, I would recommend top ant and all of my friends who are interested in podcasts.      ","Only the second time I've paid for an app, this is faultless. Brilliant interface, easy to use and download things ahead of time, works with the controls on the phone's headphones, very smart and very sophisticated. Love it.      ","Took some getting used to, but solid app. I was on the fence about this app for a long time. I just wasn't sure if I liked it or not; after a while though, I got used to it and it works really well. I've tried other options, and at the end of the day this really is the best podcast app available for Android.      ",BEST PODCAST APP EVER! DON'T BAN THIS! This is dumb! Best app ever! And ur banning it over something so incrediblely DUMB? Shame on you GOOGLE!      ,"Podcast Addict is the best Podcast app I've used up to now. Since it features many awesome things that aren't even listed by the app (DashClock Widget e.g) and works perfectly fine, I can gladly donate a bit for the dev so he can continue to work on this :) Oh, and did I mention that you don't even would have to donate to use every single awesome feature? It would be easy to lock away all of them, but to give them all users for free is a very nice thing that also convinced me to buy it.      ","I'm happy to pay for such an EXCELLENT developer and great service!! XAVIER  is an EXCEPTIONAL developer. He really listens to his users, and he's constantly making improvements based on our feedback.        PODCAST ADDICT is an excellent all-in-one podcatcher that is reliable and ready to use.                          Wide array of podcasts. Menus are thorough, and quite easy to navigate. Playlist allows sorting; marks played & partially heard. Easy backup & restore when changing devices.  Many excellent features.                                      I highly recommend it!!      ","Beyond other apps.... This app is a great find,  it brings all the podcasts to you,  easy to find,  great options for downloading,  I really like the option to download oldest first,  for some podcasts that is key!   I had been a beyond pod user,  but they redesigned and it was really clunky,  I am glad podcast addict is so easy to use while still offering the more advanced features. Thanks      ","Greatness I really appreciate development, the flexibility of the whole application, being able to add by link is very useful and simply missing in other apps, and the full featured application for free! I donated and I'm happy to do so. Dev is very good I'm tip my hat to you and you deserve every bit of that $2.99. Thanks for the continued focus on making this app better all the time and rock solid.      ","I have been using a smartphone for the last 7 years and in that time I have never reviewed an app. That in itself should speak volumes. I also had absolutely no reason to pay for this app/donate -- none. The free app has ads but I only saw them once and they were unobtrusive and default to banner and not interstitial. The app works so well that once it's configured to your liking, you don't even need to open it. There are no nag screens and no limitations (that I saw anyway).  Some people are calling the interface clumsy and I couldn't disagree more. There are a lot of settings sure but as someone that likes things to work in a very specific way, I wouldn't like the app if it were any different.   The stock Android music apps would constantly lose my place. Using this app's player podcasts now pick from where I left off every single time. It's so nice to not spend 7 minutes every car trip finding my place and hitting play.  The app is perfect. Please don't change a thing. If you must,  only rearrange what's there or add to it. Do not remove anything. I also appreciate the developer only asking for the bare minimum of permissions.  To the developer, great work and thank you.      ","I love this podcast app and listen to various podcasts with it several times a day, well worth it for this paid version. However over the last 10 days or so I've been having intermittent problems, podcasts just stop playing or what looked like one podcast playing is actually another and others getting corrupted. I do subscribe to a lot of podcasts though and there is a possibility of data corruption, either my fairly new micro sd card (not a fake one) or my phone, Moto G2 which is only a few months old.  Editing to add that it looks like the problem was with my phone (Moto G2 8gb) corruption memory cards as I've now been through two of them and need another new one. Without a memory card inserted there haven't been any more problems with garbled podcasts.  I am still having problems with playing podcasts stopping in the middle of playing and Podcast Addict quits but I also think that this is due to bad memory management on the Moto G2 as I also have it installed on my Nexus 7 v2 tablet and don't have any problems.  Sorry (to the developer) that I missed his reply asking for more details and only saw it when I came on here to update.      ","Great interface, large selection, totally worth donating I was honestly very surprised that they had certain podcast that I listen to. Odds are if you have a podcast it's on here. Really great interface, everything is nice, clean and very easy too find. Only gripe there is that the ads really bring the look down. Only tall major gripe I have is that when I use my head phone too pause and play it occasionally starts playing my music which wasn't even on. Other than that really great and handy app for podcast listeners and definitely worth hanging this guy a little      ","I loved the app until the update. I loved this app and even donated to it. This last update though removed all of my subscriptions. Why the loss of data, couldn't you have migrated it for the new version?      ","So happy I bought it! If you're new to podcasts this will get you going fast. The settings allow you to adjust nearly everything this so does, but with great power comes a difficult to learn system of menus. Check the PodcastAddict FAQs to get started and you'll have the best Podcast app on the Internet customized just for you. Well worth the effort. Great job Xavier!      ","Takes a little effort, but THE BEST Xavier has created a terrific app, pretty darn user-friendly, and X gets right back to you PERSONALLY with any queries or concerns. All kinds of awesome settings options, such as skipping intro &/or outro, which the user can designate for individual podcasts measured by the second! Throw the man some cash to get rid of ads -- TRULY AD FREE! And it's the very least you can do for a 5 star app.      ","This app = podcast perfection! I don't usually download paid versions or donate versions of apps, but Xavier has earned it tenfold! This is the only app you'll need for listening to your podcasts.  Smooth, easy gui. Sooooooo many features for every little thing you'd want.  Volume boost.  Automatic downloads and cleanup.  It's just perfect.  You won't regret downloading this.

I don't understand why sometimes it instantly merges my videos and other times it asks me what quality I want (Low, medium, high, 240p, ect). Other than that its pretty smooth.

Not the best app if you intend to do A LOT of trimming and splitting, as it makes it a tad more difficult than other similar editing apps. It's easy to use and offers a lot of great tools, but once the video is exported, the quality is shot.

There are all sorts of instructions or how to make sound come out of a phone,.  But the Shield just upgraded to Android 6 (Marshmallow), and nothing seems to work on the NSAT.  So BUYER BEWARE.  I really feel that a flaw this serious, should either be addressed, or potential buyers be forewarned.  **NOTE** Even with the third party codec for AC3 sound, it still downmixes the audio to only 2 channels (stereo). **Note Two** After owning this for a few weeks, I am upgrading my review from one to two stars,  Mainly because the program's buffering algorithms are better than other video players I've tried.  If it handled 5.1 channel audio codecs, I'd be giving it 4 or 5 stars.  Just license the stuff and charge more for the program.      ","Still the best. I've tried them all, and MX Player has been the best for years, and continues to be the best video player for Android.

One of the best features for the cost is the FVP. Rather than spending hundreds, this FPV works very well for simple flights. Just a Google cardboard for the phone and head movements control camera tilt      ","Too many bugs for a $20 app Had to completely reset my Shield K1 to to make it work, it's only 1 week old and had to be completely reset, this right here is,why this,app only gets 3 stars, for 20 bucks, I expected a lot better intergration.      ",Nothing but problems App crashes as soon as it connects to aircraft I have phantom 3 standard. Most of the time it won't even connect to the aircraft.      ,I have used this app once and I love it. Makes my phantom 3 a greater machine than it already was. I think the negative reviews it has got is because folks don't shut down the dji go app and it conflicts with the litchi.      ,Great app Out does the dji go app. You get a phantom 4 performance from your phantom 3's.      ,Buggy I use it on my LG tab 10.1 its buggy at times. Seems like the video cuts out or pixilates sometimes and the dji go app never does for me. I have tried the orbit which worked great. I think some of the coding can be cleaned up to make this a 5 easy and have people use this all the time instead of the go app.      ,great app.  but... How in the world do you change iso and shutter speed on both camera and video. i cant find where to switch from auto to manual.  p3s.      ,My go-to app for flying my P3 standard Love this app so much! Well overtaken using DJI Go after numerous updates.. love it!!      ,Problems solved I reported 3 problems and all were responded to within a short turnaround time and fixed. Great support and great app.      ,Frustrated. Bought the Litchi app and after buying this app for the crazy price of $20 then to find out certain features cost even more money. Then my tablet gets an update and Litchi doesn't work properly anymore. Then spent more Money and got an iPad thinking I'd be able to somehow use my Litchi purchase on IOS. Nope. I am not buying this app again only for it to fail again on my iPad.      ,"Great features Its worth the money for me, does everything it says. I had no video feed at first but after a reboot of my phone, the video feed started to work.      ",The developers could definetely implement some of Apple Store counterpart's features such as video resolution and framerate settings. Future updates should introduce additional options such as video quality control so that you would be able to switch between crappy 80s home video and late 90s camcorder quality. Oh and a timer tool would also be nice. Other than that this app is absolutely great and I'm really looking forward to its development.      ,"At it's current state for the Galaxy S4, it's broken. After about 20-30 seconds it starts to lose sync with the audio and the final clip becomes unusable. This app is fantastic for the iPhone and it pains me to see the lack of support from Rarevision to consistently update the app to improve it. A solid month has gone by since a real update. It really is a fantastic app guys and I want to use it a lot. I can only recommend it to phones that it actually works on.      ",I'm satisfied ! I'm amazed how identic this really looks and functions like a real VHS recorder !!! Very professional. It would be awesome if the VHS'ness could hit the sound like some distortion or crackling ! My Retro friends will here from this !         ,Worst great on s6 after fix. Amazing Love this app well worth the money. Thanks for the fix on the Samsung s6. Keep up the great work.      ,"Best VHS app out there The app runs perfectly on my Nexus 6P. The option the add a title, change the distortion and modify the date is awesome. The only thing I would like to see is 60fps recording for phones that could take advantage of it. It would greatly improve the aesthetic and look of the footage and it would let users use truly smooth slo-mo. Thanks and keep up the good work!      ","Fantastic. Works on a GS7. I've bounced around between several vhs video apps but found this one to be the best! The date and time stamp blends in with the bottom distortion and not laid on top of a treated video. I'd love to see more fine tuning effects like static pops, tracking, and tinny audio. Something like video effects from the movie Alien. Still, this is a great video app! Highly recommend!      ",Fix for Xperia Z5 The app is very good when it works but most of the time when I open the app on my Xperia Z5 the camera freezes and I have to restart. *EDIT* They fixed the problem and the app works perfectly now. Great job guys.      ,"Finally here ! Been waiting for ages ! Finally thank you rarevision ! Just on problem, can't open videos on my Sony Xperia Z3 Compact with the Album app (EDIT) Thank you for fixing this problem !   Could you maybe tweak the play button so that it opens the VHS CAMCORDER folder and not the entire gallery ?        ","good app needs a few fixes record volume from microphone is very low; needs to be amplified, the analog static is a bit annoying, an option to turn it down or off would be great. records nothing but black with low resolution mode, maybe a button to edit the titler on the main screen for convenience.      ","Must Own!! 5 star app. Lotta other pretenders out there, but this one is the standard, bar none. Authentic looking. And only $3, too. I have nothing but good things to say about this app.      ","Fantastic! Amazing reproduction of old camcorder effect, even down to the lo-fi audio output. Just noticed that it no longer works on custom rooted ROMs..... However, after a quick reinstall, it works on my rooted nexus 6p.      ",Works fine but I cant record video with my front camera. I am using a sony xperia      ,"Suddenly stopped working Error (-102, 16031701). It worked well before this sudden issue.      ","Unbelievable realism! The developers did a lot of research into the details of what made VHS look like VHS. The fact that the app can apply those effects live boggles my mind. I REALLY wish it could record 60fps like the iPhone version can, but I will rate 5 stars anyway because it works, and works REALLY well!      ",Audio error after 20 second recording It's a great application.. But the audio glitched after 20s.. hope to see the new update with the perfect audio sync.. I'm using Asus Zenfone 2..      ,Not impressed. Id like my money back please. Im on a samsung gs6. Videos wont play. Constant error. Refund please.      ,"Bug Recently bought it on my xperia m4 when I open it its working after about 3sec the video dissapears , I can't see anything. :(      ",Incredible Extremely well done. I was skeptical with the screenshots but it actually looks like that. Amazing..      ,"Authentic as Hell The only thing it needs is a camera button, so I don't have to screenshot everything when I just want a picture.      ",Best VHS App EVER Absolutely love this app and so excited it's finally on Android! I'd say it's the best one out on the Google Play. This is a simple way of getting that retro feel without having to edit on the computer. I only wish there was a way to see other videos recorded on your device have playback and an option to be saved.      ,"Won't work with gallery Downloaded the app to run a video through it that I recorded previously, and all it does is open the gallery within the app and let's me view my videos. Waste of money and unable to refund!?      ",It's perfect As a 90s kid this made me feel very nostalgic.      ,"I love it, but I wish the selfie mode didn't reverse the screen - it compliments no one! It would also be nice to be able to pause the video...      ",Great app.. simulates my old VHS Cam in everything...  Just it should be a bit more colorful recording.. image's saturation a bit low..but okay      ,"Great app It's   great app but unfortunately it doesn't give me the option of choosing where I want to save my videos, hence three stars instead of 4 or 5      ",It's sick dude My only complaint is that it needs a pause button! Then it's Perfect!      ,Blegoflame This is way better than the other vhs apps i love it!      ,Great Exceptional effects quality but it is missing some features found on the iOS version.      ,Instantly fell in love with this app      ,So good I don't want to get a refund The $4.15 is very tempting to get back after recording.

",Now works in 6P as well      ,Photo mode It's literally the only thing missing!      ,Best surveillance software i have used I love everything about BlueIris.  I have been using it for five years now.  I was a bit upset when they were forcing ppl to upgrade by not supporting the older version (video playback of alerts on mobile was no longer working for almost everyone using the older version).I called in to report the issue a while back and was told the older version was at end of life and their development team cannot devote any time to old version.  It seemed really shady but they finally fixed the issue!  Thank you Blue Iris!      ,"Works for my needs I have a different configuration then most as I am using both an analog DVR system with 4 cameras and 3 IP cameras.  This app and desktop software have been perfect for me to combine two different CCTV systems in one convenient app and software.   Incidentally I am on satellite internet service which can best be described as slightly better than dial up, and yet I have had no issues viewing my cameras remotely.  Slow to load initially but other than that works well.      ",Must have app for Blue Iris Works great on mobile phone (Samsung S5) and media hub (Minix X8-H Plus). Just make sure you configure WAN router and Blue Iris as per the Help guide (Networking section) in Blue Iris.      ,This used to be good I have to reinstall the software all the time to get there live feeds or playback video to work.  Very frustrating      ,Room for Improvement A great start but I wish it had more functionality for changing settings like the server.      ,Love this app!  Great for seeing motion alerts on the fly.      ,"Still hate it! Greedy! Force users to upgrade. DO NOT BUY!!! or UPDATE Post December Release. Alert list view had no listener to play alert video. I explained this to support via email, but they have no clue. Blue Iris sold off to someone else? This is their response...  ""I apologize, but the solution we have it is to upgrade. Due to limited resources, we are not able to provide further guidance regarding this at this time, and cannot in the future, guarantee compatibility of the app with older versions."" Total BS! There is no need for anyone needing to      ","Good and reliable app The app and software behind it on your server are loaded with features that will take you months to fully use. If you bought equivalent software from Adobe or another big software house, it would cost $300.      ","Perfect, always exceeds my expectations. When I had ideas to improve system, support included them in future release.      ","$60 should buy reliability Live feeds break on updates requiring reinstall/reconfiguration of mobile and desktop software, and after doing all that it still might not work. Needs better QA before pushing updates. You never know when you will be rendered unable to see your cameras, which makes a mobile app pointless.      ","Almost Awesome A couple of misses. I've requested it to the developer several times, but the Android version lacks the ability to run in the background and/or play audio when the screen is locked. The IOS version does this very well. Forces me to use TinyCam which does not stream as well. Secondly, I upgraded from a Samsung GS5 to a GS7, Now geofencing seems to be broke. I have to launch the app for it to figure out I'm back inside the fence. Thirdly,  I wish they would bring back the old PTZ controls. Otherwise awesome      ",Works great again..not anymore Haven't bought new build so app is pretty much worthless.      ,"Good companion app The only negative is you have to reconfigure the app and desktop every time there is an app update. If not, the live stream just says loading forever. Overall works pretty good.      ",Clips don't play Updated the app and now the clips don't work...  Extremely disappointed that I can't fix it      ,"Buggy I used to be able to remove alerts by swiping sideways. It does not work now so not sure why and no reply from request sent to support. I don't get some screens mentioned on the help page. Other than those couple of niggling annoyances, the app seems to work ok.      ","Doesn't work, never has. I can't make it work for my Foscam 9821Ps no matter what the tech support people say. It refuses to recognize my password or username. Unable to get any help from anyone.      ","June 7th update.   After four straight 13.5 hour days of using the WAN, and no ""CRASHES"", I have decided to up my rating back to five stars!  Thanks Ken for having your developer finally fix the app crashing issue.  I like the smaller thumbs, as I think that was the root issue from the get-go.  Seemed like when you had more than40 or so alerts was when the app crashed the most.   As far as the few crashed while using Wi-Fi, I can live with that!!!!  Again, thanks Ken for listening and getting the app fixed.      ",Playback choppy both locally and remotely. Broken again after recent update. VERY choppy remote playback. Worked perfect before update.      ,"A lot of improvement needed Spent $50 on the software then $10 on the app and I can't use half the settings.  Notifications do not work, I can not reset the camera and settings do not stay.  Lost connection to one camera and can not get it back from the app.  Not happy but already spent the money :/      ",Continually degrading... I bought the PC and Android app a year ago and it seems like each update to both platforms reduces the usability incrementally. Currently on an Moto x pure and after moving into a new house and updating both server and client from a 1+ month old version the PTZ is intermittent on my Foscam cameras and the android app can no longer see  live feeds or alert clips. I'm beginning to dread that rotating refresh arrow as that is all I see. Having to consider other options now.      ,"Needs much improvement For a $10 app after buying $50 software this app is nearly non functional. Cannot adjust camera settings from app, reset camera, won't give push notifications, no led for notification, etc. Have a camera that's not viewable with blue iris but is with camera branded app and cannot reset the camera via blue iris on the road. Wasted my money.      ",Great Great      ,"Most functions work I am using hikvision cameras and audio is garbled, also I don't get alerts on my s6. Otherwise it's been working well.      ","Wonderful Quick, easy, and wonderful application:) Very satisfied.      ",Well done This mobile app has features that many desktop surveillance applications don't!      ,I'm changing from 3 stars to 5 Grate app very satisfied with it after a few patches it works flawlessly. I've been using the app around one year or so I  the beginning it was constantly crashing on me but thanks to updates it works as it supposed to that is why I'm changing my rating to 5 stars.      ,Works great Must have app if you have blue iris software on your PC.      ,Blue Eye Overall Works fine. Not sure what logout bug fix is?      ,Amazing app This in conjunction of the desktop version is just amazing. I run a small server at home with a very high speed connection and multiple mp cams and this program is so fluid. I love it and I will live longer without the stress of not knowing why my alarm is going off when I'm 100 miles or more from home. The cameras tell me it all. Thanks to the dev for all your hard work you rock bro.      ,"Awesome! This is app, combined with the PC software is a great home security solution. Even now, I am still adding and growing the system and its all so easy to do with this app and software.      ",Works great! Works great as a remote solution for Blue Iris on the PC. You can access your camera controls and play back alerts from your history.      ,Best app for blue iris      ,"The PC version of this app is a highly configurable and solid piece of software, but I needed an app that would let me control my multiple cameras remotely from my Nexus 6 phone. Since this app was written to work with the PC version, it's exactly what I needed. A little pricey, but I don't mind paying for a good solid app that does what I want it to do.      ","I have multiple servers and have used this on tablets and phones.  Recently upgraded our phones to Motorola X Pure editions and this app no longer works.  You can log in and get your camera list but any attempt to view a live camera or previous recording causes the app to sit at the ""loading"" screen.      2016-02-17 - Support has been notified and we exchanged emails on the issue I am experiencing.  Will update this review once the issue is resolved.  Phones: MotoX Pure Android: 6.0 Multiple Servers:  4.2.9.3 x64  2016-02-26 - Working like a champ on MotoX Pure now.  Assume the latest server update resolved whatever issue it was.  Thanks!!!      ",Works great and smooth. 2/28 - This is a great supplement if you run BlueIris. I'm able to view recordings and can easily select the date and time. The interface is catching on to ease of use compared to built in software for other NVR'S. Currently have it working with 4 different brand of Cameras. Have not used sound/microphone. Will update if anything changes.      ,"Reliable with a couple of quirks I have used this app for over a year. I liked it but have never been able to use the microphone on my Samsung s5. I had assumed that it was just an android thing until I saw that it works on my old original  galaxy 10.1 tab. before this. Without this feature I have jump between apps to accomplish use of the microphone. Also when reviewing clips remotely the clip will freeze if you enable sound or attempt to fast forward. Its been a good app, my needs have changed and made these 2 issues a bid deal.      ","So far, so great! After testing a few desktop apps, including iSpy (which was a nightmare in some aspects) and a much more expensive option, I chose Blue Iris. I bought the desktop app today and then the Android app. For $70 you can't do better IMO. I record to my Google Drive and every clip is uploaded to my FTP server. I have 5 IP cameras of mixed brands and capabilities, 2 Android phones as cameras and BI has been rock solid over the last 10 days. Should this change I will update my review and rating.

Very happy with it and it does exactly what it says on the tin. 5 stars from me...        ,Update broke app For the last few months the app has suffered from horrible stuttering.

It's greatest strength is its complexity and versatility to control and access the video feeds via multiple devices and protocols, where competing products are severely limited in order to appeal to the less tech savvy user.

","This is almost perfect, very very powerful and a reminder of why I switched to Android in the first place.   The functionality on this is astounding.  I wasn't sure what to expect but this really is a pretty good CCTV / Webcam option.     There's a couple of very small issues and one or two things which could be improved but it's still one of the best examples of a very VERY functional app I've seen on Android in a long time.  Right now it's hooked up to mains power for me, recording video based on motion or audio detection, I can go to a web interface and grab the files, remotely delete them - etc.     Real good stuff, despite the tiniest of issues, I still think this is easily worth 5* and the money.

I don't even need the pro features, I'm just buying it as a show of gratitude.      ",Very useful. Made my Nexus 5 an amazingly good webcam for macro and highly detailed up close capture with controls from the browser. Liked it so much I bought the Pro version.   Take your time to learn all the different things it can do. Can view the video stream on VLC and control from the browser. It will drain the battery very fast on the device so take that into consideration for remote devices that you need to have cordless. Adjust the caching down on the network stream to minimize lag to VLC in the VLC network controls.      ,"This app is amazing! I highly recommend both the pro and lite version, they are truly an amazing complete set of rugged useful features. Huge thanks to the developer, made great use out of old androids. Also great to see another member of the RepRap community.      ",Very good Excellent although the little bug makes both Focus and Flash somehow share the same options. Ex. you 'can' set your flash mode to Macro or Infinite making it a nasty bug      ,"Awesome app! Suggestion for the developer: Multiple User Access with restriction settings for non admin users would be super useful! Great way to re-purpose old phones into something useful instead of just throwing them in the garbage. On device recording is great. Battery in my old LG Optimus last over 5 hours with minimal options set. Love this app, very polished and tons of options/ flexibility. Hint: If you need a static IP it must be set in your Android wifi settings.      ",Needs native FTP upload Very polished but needs native FTP upload like most FTP cameras have. Having to purchase another app (tasker) to do this is not ideal.      ,"Impressive I was impressed with the free version, even though it was a little quirky. Bought this anyway to support the developer. The Pro version is a million times better. No ads, shortcut to start the server, and the sliding camera controls via the web interface actually work now! (they did not in the free version, even on the same device). The pro version even uses less bandwidth - in the free version, it would take up my entire 5MBPS upload limit no matter what quality stream I selected. In the pro version, even higher quality streams use less bandwidth! My antique Nexus 7 gen 1 tablet runs this well for extended periods!  Great job, dev! Hope you keep up with updates!      ","Great Only one matter,,I can't record video on mp4 format. Could u help please?      ","Good app but really needs to self delete videos when set on motion detection, please add option      ","Works well. It's seems a bit buggy. It works well but touchy on my Galaxy s2 and I can't install the pro version. (Claims ""insufficient memory"")The lite version will do. Thank you. It's a fun app.      ","The app itself is great, however there is a bug. If you leave this running after a few hours it will drop to the configuration screen. I have emailed the developer 3 times, but no response.  However if this can be fixed it will be a 5      ","Great app, but the cleanup function doesn't work. It's supposed to delete old files....      ",Great app I am using this to repurpose an old phone as well as turn my daily driver into an ad hoc web camera. The pro version offers tons of options within Tasker. Responsive developer. I emailed a question and got an answer right away. Works great with tinycam monitor.      ,"Works well and does what it is meant to do Worth the upgrade, in my opinion. Works like a charm and never have a problem with it.      ","In general this has been a great app doing what it claims.  However, I have 2 nagging problems:  1)  The camera kept stopping and return back to the config menu after running for a while.  2)  I use tinycam Monitor software, and it kept failing to connect to IP web cam every now & then.  Not sure which app is causing the disconnect.  Would have been 5 stars if I can solve these 2 problems      ",Are you able to refund if their is not enough space R u able 2 refund if there's not enough space      ,Superb I am a CCTV engineer and this app is one of my most frequently used tools.      ,"Input issues Great on paper, except that cellphones' head tracking ability is far from perfect, and I can't get the thing to read inputs from a USB device. I use my OTG cable to connect my keyboard or gamepad, both of which work outside the video player (even to navigate the menus within the app!) But I can't use those things to actually reorient the video player when the head tracking inevitably drifts. Fix this and it's 5 stars.      ",Vr player pro. Love this app. But every time I return from settings the aspect ratio has turned into 4x3. The only way to get the proper ratio is to reenter open files and restart movie. A bit of a pain when you are trying to fine tune your screen.      ,Great! The head tracking with my SGS6 isn't as good as the head tracking with my One Plus 2 phone (It's perfect!) It's a good idea to test a phone with this app and Cardboard if you're into VR and want a good experience.      ,There didn't seem to be a slideshow facility for pictures in the free version so I got the paid version thinking it may be a paid only function but it doesn't seem to be able to do it either. It's pretty pointless only being able to view one picture and not scroll backwards and forwards (or have an automatic timed option) through the whole album/directory or am I missing something? I'm not begrudging paying  1.28 for it as I'll probably still use it for videos but needs more photo viewing slideshow functions (particularly the ability to advance/go backwards through photos with a Bluetooth controller).      ,Very good foundation Already very much usable VR video player. Some more features and polish and it's there. Edit: You should wrap subtitles inside the screen. Long subtitles just go off-screen for me when watching external subtitles at least. Embedded mp4 subtitles work very well.      ,"Far from perfect. But its the best of the bunch imo Doesn't work since the latest update. Blank white screen as soon as I launch the app, on my S5. UPDATE: I'm loving the new features and UI since your most recent update, have changed my rating to 5*. Unfortunately I can't get my cardboard 2.0 to work well with my Samsung S5, but that's no fault of the app. Thanks for the reply and keep up the good work!      ",Since last major update last year it's no more possible to fine adjust display settings (position and size of the 2 views). Therefore unusable on Nexus 6 because of double vision issue! Can you developer get a Nexus 6 and test it out?!? If I remember right we paid for this app!      ,Neat app Works well with a vr headset I got for Christmas. Has some weird tracking issue though where the video continually pans to the right and I have to keep re-entering the video.      ,Input Bug Having the same issues reported by other users regarding external inputs. Fix it and it's 5 stars!      ,"The videos play ok until I switch to cardboard mode. Then it starts stuttering. Any solution to that? Otherwise a great app, sadly this is a critical point for immersion! UPDATE: I'm using a Galaxy S6. I tried restarting the phone, and I can see some degradation after I load the second movie - but even the first is not as slick as the video player or homido player. I really hope you guys can fix this!      ","Good Good app but needs more screen adjustments and the ""url"" feature is good, but a direct youtube search would be great as the url feature is hit and miss if it will work or not.      ","Poor stuttery performance On my very capablleGalaxy Note 5, this app somehow still has trouble running  even a 1080p 180 degree VR video at a relatively high bit rate without immersion-breaking stuttering and low framerate. 2160p, 15000 or above bit rate runs even worse. I know it's  not my phone at fault because I've tried the same videos in another  VR video player app called ""AAA VR Cinema Cardboard and that runs high res & bit rate videos perfectly. It's  too bad, because VR Player Pro has the best customization options.      ","For a few bucks, this quality player is a good steal. There was some hiccups with some releases, but overall it is at the pinnacle of performance in the VR league. Recommended for anyone who wants the real deal. I can't wait to see what's coming next ..everything happens so fast nowadays!      ","I thought the pro version of this app was great for my S5, a 5 star program easily. However I upgraded to the S7 Edge this weekend and now whenever I try to open files from my SD card it says ""can not open file"". They opened fine on the SD card when it was in my S7. Can anyone help? I'll upgrade to 5 stars when this is fixed but at the moment it's useless.      ",Love it. Virtual Reality never felt so good. Watching my stored videos in a unique way is a dream come true not to mention the ability to watch 3d videos and YouTube videos. I highly recommend this product to VR enthusiasts.      ,"Not consumer-ready Wouldn't load the first video I tried, but also gave no error message--just silently ignored the command. I tried a stream from the author's own site, and that worked, but it never hides the control overlay or title bar, which interferes a bit with VR. Double-tap to calibrate wouldn't work with the magnet in cardboard 1.0, so I had to pull the phone out of cardboard frequently. It's mostly okay once it gets a vid going, but it's very unpolished.      ","Stuttering badly 3D video over LAN will stutter badly(pausing for a moment for every few seconds of play), making it unusable. SpherePlay does not have this issue. Please optimize this so that it can flawlessly play video over a network drive without stuttering. I am using note 5 with ES explorer to choose which file to play over LAN. Most of the vr files are on the network drive since they mobile has limited space.      ",Used to be better. Why do my settings reset to default every time I load a video? Very annoying. Video is also choppy. Taking refund. (Droid turbo)      ,"Works well enough, loved it especially for its customization options (projections, FOV etc). This is also one of the few cardboard VR apps that can be used on the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 without drifting (well it still drifts, but it will ""compensate"" eventually unlike almost all other apps, where drift is ever constant).   However, there is a small trouble for controlling with bluetooth peripherals (keyboard, joypad etc). It would seem that most of the time, the app will ignore inputs from such devices (they worked in other apps and at the homescreen). And once in a while, it will suddenly start working as it's supposed to. I have no idea and can't find out how to reliably make the app recognize bluetooth device inputs (they worked great when it works, but most of the time it doesn't). So I will definitely give it 5 stars when this small issue is fixed.      ","Recent update broke some things. I loved this app, it worked brilliantly. It's unfortunate that after a recent update that some key functionalities have broken. Currently running on a Xperia Z5 premium. Was utilizing a ps4 controller via Bluetooth for controlling which no longer functions regardless of how I map the buttons. Also, was using the head shaking motion to recenter and recalibrate the screen, but now it works spotty at best, requiring a large amount of force to register. Please consider working on these issues in the near future      ",Needs improvement but gets the job done The app menu does not rotate in both directions. My problem with the HTC One m8 is I can only have my headphone jack to the left. So the apps menu is upside down when in use.      ,"Latest version rubbish Option to put padding between viewports has gone. This is fairly annoying. Can't open files from SD card on either file browser (crashes in simple mode when trying to go to root folder to move to SD card, the other just won't open the files). Can only open files in external app but most settings change to defaults each time. Flickering problem seems to be fixed but tracking drifts now. A formerly brilliant app; it's really disappointing now. Crashes on Marshmallow a lot during play. Devs unresponsive.      ","Option to remember projection type!! Excellent app, almost - but how is the user supposed to tolerate viewing many media of same projection type (in my case spherical images) when the projection setting reverts to ""Plane"" each time a new file is loaded? An obvious fix, please just add a ""remember setting"" toggle beneath the projection options so the user only needs to specify this once, if need be. Then I can stop pulling my hair out :)      ","Awesome player. Must have This is a MUST have for gear vr users. Need to have cardboard for gear installed first. Smacks down the standard vr gallery for a six. Watch 3d sbs in correct aspect so 3d ratio or adjust it so it's not squashed. If you double tap main control button it re aligns screen where ever you look, so I can full lay down and watch a movie AWESOME. Two things I would like to see. Option for gear vr in head display. Also a big cinema size screen. Instructions need to be clearer to use.      ",No longer able to play high res videos After the marshmallow update I'm no longer able to play high res videos that I was able to play before. It says error reading media. I am able to play them using other video players though.      ,Used to love it 1st time I bought it i was in love it was amazing. Got a new s6 (same phone) and it seems the update version of this app has insane scaling or ratio problems. I can't seem to watch the same exact videos anymore      ,Inter lens distance wrong This doesn't seem to be implementing the interlens distance correctly as I'm getting double vision in everything.  Other vr apps work fine and I'm now using a free vr player that does the job better than this that I paid for.  Wish I could get my money back      ,"Great set of features and amazing performance compared to other players, but some videos just give you an ""error while loading media' Can't rate this higher because of this.      ",No DTS support. this player will not play audio for most of the movies because of this. haven't been able to use much because of this reason. i have the pro version and my phone is Sony Z2      ,"Like other players, it is intended for video. It doesn't have a slide show option for still photographs. I don't understand why it doesn't have slide show capabilities. VR users will take still photos, both 360 and 180 degree varieties. This player should support them.   An even bigger problem is one pointed out by other reviewers, it does not remember your settings. Here is an example. I have a collection of 180 strereo still photographs (side-by-side). To view them I have to search for and select one (it won't play all the files in a directory). Then switch to stereo (3D), then switch to ""Dome"" projection. That's about five steps and requires that I take the phone out of the viewer. To see the next photo I have to repeat THE WHOLE PROCESS. So this viewer is useless for viewing still images.   Seriously guys, you didn't think of this? Didn't notice it is a problem?      ",Update caused drifting on gs3 After the update it runs smooth but theres a bad drifting issue. Ive tried to calibrate it many ways suggested and nothing has worked. Ive tried to use every sensor setting and still drifts.      ,Good enough! Options like remote (Bluetooth device) recentering or locking position would give you all 5*! Now I have to slide out and in the phone every time it loose its orientation - every few minutes...      ,"No magnet support so it's a no go Well, it supports my Zeiss viewer now which is great and it has plenty of settings and it might be great but it's a total deal breaker that it doesn't respond to the magnet like all the other VR players I've tried do. I don't want to fire up my Moga controller every time I want to watch a video.      ","Best Ever Tried all VR Player and nothing compare to this. Use the compass+ accelerometer feature if you're using cheap smartphone. No other app has it! Some suggestion (for 5 star): More input button option like double tap button, triple tap, etc. Buffering adjustment for playing video on ftp/nas. Exit option on menu.      ",Broken after latest update. Please fix! This app was great but is basically useless to me in its current state.                                                             *Update: I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but I am still unable to play files from a USB drive and my Bluetooth mini game pad still doesn't work aside from the back button. Is there a way to map the remote buttons so it will work again? It looks to be set correctly but doesn't work during playback.  Thanks!      ,"Very nice software, could use some updates here and there (waiting for the big release you guys are promising ;) ) Also a version for the gearvr would be awesome, since it has way more powerful sensors. Keep up the good product!      ",This WAS the best VR media player. But it's worthless for 3D content now. Updates have crippled it.  You used to be able to adjust the horizontal and vertical offsets (a.k.a. the IPD) but that was removed with v2. With out that setting 3D content doesn't work on my Nexus 6 + Knox v2 cardboard.  I purchased this quite a while ago and had lots of use out of the previous version which is the only reason I've not asking for a refund.   I would say look at VRTV instead for 3D content.      ,"Please, add the support of choosing the projection by default, it really pisses off when you have to choose it every time you need to open new video!      ",Best option to play VR no doubt. I'm using VR Player Pro on my Galaxy S5 device. Videos play amazingly well. I'm glad there's an option to reset the camera position. But it rarely drifts (something that happened often in the AAA VR Cinema). There's no lag. And it's played virtually every file I've put on it! EDIT: They've replied to my review and the VR Menu now works! The only thing I could suggest to make this any better is a seek function for the VR Menu like the one in the YouTube 360 app :)      ,"Hard to control panel by voice or megnet Input no use, or fail function, otherwise it's good      ","Dude, I very rarly will give five stars.  But, I am a novice DJ and I love techno music.  I was going to go out and buy a expensive controler, and I still am when I can afford it and I become more skilled, but it is hard to control or really get into it with just a mouse.  And, I really didn't think this would work at all, BUT THIS IS THE TICKET.  I works flawlessly and I feel like I am actually playing an instrument or something.  I can focus on the mix and not the mouse pointer.  I totally recommend this app.  Also, one major advantage this app has over a pro controler is that you can't dance around the room like you can with a tablet or smartphone.      ","Cannot get working with android 3 days I've been trying to get it working with my note 5. Tried 4 different WiFi connections , reinstalled bonjour. Still no luck. Of course its too late to get a refund. Waste of 10 bucks.      ",Great App I really needed this because my audience was in another room. So this allowed me to stay in the room with them and operate the decks remotely. Super! 10 usd investment allowed my bar to make an extra 1000 usd of sales for that day.      ,O M G! so much fun and easier to mix and remix songs with on the fly. Not as good as a actual controller but perfect for starting dj's who can't afford a controller yet. A Bit of a tricky setup but if you know virtual dj program then its a breeze. Was easy for me because i remember seeing about the Remote menu option in settings and the required Apple program is not a worry for windows users. I strongly recommend this app for any dj's starting out who can't afford a dj controller yet.      ,"Works perfect on Note 3 The only issue i had was connecting the app to my pc. You have to go into your pc app options and press connect. Besides the bad installation instructions, its work perfect.

How do you change it to how its pictured ?      ",Skin great app. works perfect. but it should be specified that the app download is not the skin in the photographs. was looking forward to hitting my cue points from across the room tonight. but my license doesn't allow me to have cues on my version? or does it vary by device as well?      ,Works brilliant Why don't you try switching off your firewall setting or adjusting them. Make sure you on the same server. Mine even works with my myfi. Easy as.      ,Good stuff Work very well between mac and android      ,Works well but does need improvement The app works well on my galaxy note pro tablet and is very handy but it does definitely need to be improved so that it more closely emulates the actual desktop and android skins need to be developed. It definitely needs a better way to view and search your music library and it needs timer displays in each deck.  I do like it though.      ,Other reviews are misleading I read lots of the reviews did not want to buy it but I thought I would spend the tenner and it is unreal it ever works through the hotspot on your phone      ,Can't I can't use it on my tablet and it won't open into the mixer.      ,Best Dj App Ever! I've waited so long for this app to come to android and that moment is FINALLY here. Thank you so much Atomix for this app. It's worth every cent of that $10! It's the ultimate crowd pleaser and let's me have more interaction with my guests. It's the reason I'm a loyal Virtual Dj customer.  They're miles ahead of Serato when it comes to innovation.      ,Worthless on Galaxy S3 Really wanted this to work. Spent hours trying to get it to connect. Chat Support at VDJ was a joke.

Hi, perhaps the devs can help me. Tried 8 OTG devices, none are being recognized, with a range of USB keys on them. Can't even get past that step.

Used to love this app, even though it didn't let me change, move, rename files or anything else.. at least it let me access files from usb on my tablet. Until I updated and the app interface was changed to orange surg no way to change it. Devs should be handing out sunglasses with this app of they make chances like that.. or maybe just including that info in the description, maybe? that was the day I stopped using, but since I had to pay for this app, guess Devs don't care. I would not recommend this app for this reason, I mean honestly.      ","New life for my Xoom Best $4 spent, works with my patriot micro USB/3.0 otg flash drive.

For this they will ask u to send mail. But they will respond with prerecorded message like , check your otg and whether it is properly connected. Might be bad OTG cable, connect with brand new OTG.

Great little app. The free version is pretty good as is, but paying the extra buck for the ""pro"" version is totally worth it. The Sharing feature makes it super easy to hide your files, and hidden files are easy to organize in as many folders as you want or need. If I were to ask for one small improvement, it would be nice if there were a way to ""tag"" your photos and videos. It would speed up finding them a bit to just search for tags.

Any chance at getting me a refund?      ,"I'm won over!!! I can honestly say this has been one of the more useful apps on the playstore that I've used to date. Still some minor tweaks to be done, but beyond the potential behind this app, the customer service is what earned it the 5 stars. How personable the responses are, how timely the get back to your concern, etc! Top notch!!!      ","Won't Open I just downloaded the app and everytime I try to open it, I get an error message saying the app has stopped. Apparently the app isn't compatible with the s7, but that information isn't on this page.      ",So many bugs where do I start. Focus lock doesn't lock still hunts at times same goes for exposure. That anti shake button does work. Some of the resolutions cause a weird blurry bar to appear near the bottom of the screen. This app is made for Apple and brought over here without getting it right for some quick cash.      ,Great app This is one of the best camera apps I've found for Android      ,"Now a great app! I started having problem with the app having corrupted video most of the time. Contacted the support team,  which is very great! I also had a problem with the focus and exposure receptacle, and told them my problem. They acknowledged the problem and addressed it within a few days! Now i took like 10 vids in succession and it now worked perfectly. This is 5 stars for me,  just because of the support they are giving in the android version. These guys are serious!      ","Should have waited with Android release.  There are just too many issues for this app to be considered stable and too many features missing ""while we are working on them."" There's also a problem with excessive contrast that can't be adjusted. Sure, you can underexpose and hope to restore detail in darker areas in post production. But for a ""state-of-the-arts"" app, that's unacceptable. I recognise that creating a sophisticated app that works equally well on many Android phones is a much taller order than it is for the few iPhone variants. But that's precisely why they should have waited or at least waited to charge for an unfinished product. Bad sport!!      ","The Android version of this app still needs a lot of love. I'm using it on my Samsung S7 and there are several features that either don't work or are broken in some fashion or another. A few cases in point, I cannot control the mic audio gain at all. The slider moves up and down properly, but doesn't affect the audio feed whatsoever. Another is the focus lock. I can move the slider which will temporarily move the camera focus to that point, but then the camera immediately attempts to auto focus on something else within the frame. Even without the use of the slider, setting the app to lock the focus does nothing. The camera focus on whatever it feels is the main subject. Exposure is also somewhat broken. While I can manually set exposure and it does stay locked, moving the exposure reticle to different parts of the view does absolutely nothing. It's always using a weighted balance over the entire image. So, i have to full frame a section that has the correct exposure, then lock that level, and finally pull back to the scene I want to capture. There are more problems, but I'm out of words for one review.  If they can mirror the iPhone app (which I also have) 5 stars. For now only 3.      ",Update broke it again :-( Since the last update I get this weird warped effect at the bottom of the video? Please fix as was really getting into this app!!      ,"FPS problem Hi. Bought this app last night. Great app, but im having a bit of a problem about the fps. Why is is that whenever i record i dont get exactly 24 fps, i get somewhere between 22-23 fps. How do i have a fix fps. My device is samsung galaxy s6      ","Not opening in my SONY XPERIA Z5 PREMIUM. I have purchased this app 2 days ago. In the beginning I could open the app, but not able to shoot. I have shared my device info with filmic pro team by mail. Yesterday,  I got some update of the app which I have installed. Now, app is not opening.  Please help me.      ",Nothing good Paid for this app and only the start screen shows. How do I get a refund? Not worth the money i paid or the time it took to install. (S6 EDGE)      ,Love it Awesome video application      ,Nice...ui a little clunky      ,Galaxy Note 5 Enjoyed this update. You adressed the shutter speed issue on Note 5. And focus reticle is improved on Note 5      ,"Poor optimization on Nexus 6 and LG G3 I'm sure this app is great for iPhones, but it doesn't seem to work well on Android devices. Moving the focus reticle does not lock onto the intended object and it becomes blurred. Moving the auto exposure reticle does not work at all. I had big hopes for this app, but it is a big disappointment. I wish I could get a refund but my 2 hours are up. Don't make the same mistake I made. They should offer a free ""lite"" version so users can test compatibility with their devices.      ","Poorly thought out but great start Although this is a very powerful video recording app, it is implemented in a way that is illogical for Android users.  One example is the ""remove"" button in the clips browser. Why couldn't you just use the word ""delete""? The developers should remember that these are not Apple users using FilMic on Android, these are Android users who may never have seen your Apple app! Another example is scrolling through the menus. It is completely illogical for an Android user. With all that said it is a very powerful video recording app. My favorite feature is the ability to set the file names by project, and have them incrementaly updated as I create new takes. So from an engineering perspective it's a magnificent app, but please hang the Apple GUI designer from a tree, and get someone more used to developing GUI on Android!      ","The android version of this App does NOT have the same framerates and resolutions as the iOs version.  The app is fine, but the big selling point was customization.  I wanted to use this app for specific framerates and slow/fast motion effects that I cannot choose because they aren't on the limited preset list.  Including anything above 30fps at any resolution.  There are also no resolutions between 2k and 4k which I would have liked to used for stabilization and/or downscaling in post.  (also annoying that all the cool aspect ratios like cinemascope are crops from 1080p only, a minor quibble since there are guides).  There's nothing ""wrong"" with this app so much as it is clearly using its success on ios to sell itself while not making it clear (Except in fine print) the android version does not have the same capabilities leading to disappointment.      ","It's OK The app seems OK but I can't even save preset video settings, not sure why, I've tried 3 times with no success.

",External SD causes crash plus more woes Colour temperature stuck on green. Black screen after a few seconds of recording. LG G4      ,Awesome I want to start off by saying I love this app because I've seen what it is capable of on the ios platform. With that said I've encountered some issues while playing around with it on my Galaxy Note 5. After recording a clip only the audio will playback in the Filmic library and in the phone's gallery. I also had an issue while trying to use headphone monitoring while using an external microphone. Another thing is that would be nice is to have an image flip option for using DSLR lens adapters.      ,"Good onion skin animator Quick simple and easy to use.A insert frame function would help though so animations can be smoothed out.  Edit: Now has insert,thanks.      ","Great start but missing a couple things I've been using this to create mobile application demos. It's missing the ability to select and move multiple frames. The gift export is a bit grainy. The ability to export is in your friend is missing. But, great start!  Oh.... I also need the ability to change our board sizes.      ",Let down Love the app but I was under the impression -due to another review- that I would be able to edit the slide length (slides last longer than a second) but I can't. The only function I was interested in enough to pay.      ,"Great except for the Uploading... I Love this app, so many possibilites for making animations, But when i try to upload to facebook it says it cant. And it failed the upload. Please fix this,  also, Please let there be a way to add music/audio from your phone music or something? Please?      ","Great, but... I love this app, this is a nice way to quickly design features for 2d games... But, I can't upload the movies I make! Youtube upload says that my movie is being uploaded and check the progress from notification area, but nothing happens. Exporting to dropbox or drive doesn't work either.   5 stars are waiting for me to solve this problem, 3 stars until then. :)      ","Update? BTW AWESOME APP Please add voice/music and the cooler wheel with the square in the middle and an option for Project video quality. Please it would make life easier. Plus (sorry but I'm just spiting out ideas) motion blur, more layers , and backups. Thank you for your time :D      ","Great quick onion animator! Awesome for quick and fun animations with my Note 2. Only problem is that sometimes when trying to draw with the pen it initiates the ""selection/move"" box instead of drawing, but it's not that often.  Would love to see some clipping masks added to the layer options! Great app, looking forward to future updates!      ",It GREAT but.... I can't like get the unlocked to work can you please help me I really want to try      ,I like it its fun because I make movie and I use my drawings The onlything is I wish it was free for more people can get it      ,"5 stars! Definitely an easy practical app. It would be nice to add music and sound fx. Another plus, it being on my note 3 makes it convenient and fun to use!      ",Finally a decent app worth to own forever! Super easy way to have fun and practice your animation on the go! I will give you 6 stars if add the feature to import audio for some lip sync!  Bravo!!!      ,"Amazing Love this app so much. Super easy to use and allows complete freedom when animating. Despite this there are some things that could be added: Greyscale: there is very limited grey colours and it gets a bit annoying sometimes. A Glowing pen tool, more rulers e.g. triange and have a feature that allow you to make and save your own ruler tool.  Please add      ","Very good despite some flaws First off, this is a very well put together animation program with a very focused and minimalist approach. I enjoy being able to work on little animations while on my break at work. The downside us that it tends to be a little crash-happy. Also I would appreciate more export options.      ","I have an idea! ok, I've been thinking of some awesome options for the unlocker, for example, if you can add sound to the animation, and for each time you play the animation you hear the sound at the same time. it would be perfect so the video and sound sync, so it is easier for smoother animating and also so you don't mess up, next would be a blur tool, for special opacity, which would be great for people who want frames that create a nice fade in or fade out (or just to add a nice shade to their creation), more layers (10 at least),and a option where you can merge the layers you pick, also it would be great if you can change layers (example: 1st layer moves over 2nd so the layer originally on top is covered) lastly, an option where you can include images for some frames/layers, that would be so amazing! ^-^  (Sorry if I sound a bit selfish, but these are just some things that I've thought about to make the app even better! :3)      ","Great app For the price this little animation app is awesome, gives you all the tools you need with a sweet interface. I would like to see the ability to create more layers and possibly better export but seriously this app is great and I'm happy with it :D      ",Love It! As a professional animator who is cursed with ideas that may never see the light of day this app provides a great way to create notes of the imagination. Unlocker is worth it since onionskin is a valuable tool for animation. Considering this is only on my phone & i can only do so much there...ill just say it has been extremely fun creating little animations on the fly & can share on twitter. Its as fun as you make it. I have noticed a bug though of end frames getting lost at render but not often.      ,"Lots of fun. I love this app. So easy, my 8 yr old figured it out. I wish it had at least 5, 6 layers to work with, and a pan/zoom feature.. but even without, it's still cool. I'd happily  pay $10 for this app as is, and more with other features. Also, it's a ton of fun on the 12.2'' note pro screen.      ","amazing This app is exccellent for making rough drafts or even basic animations on the go!! i usually make a really rough animation using this app and a galaxy note pro 12.2 , then when i get to my p.c i navigate to the obb folder in my tablets internal storage and transfer the frames into my computer so that i can work on them in photoshop, flash or any other full featured p.c animation program. i dont know if this is possible but the only thing this needs is the ability to draw over video that you have taken with your tablet or phones camera, this app would be some truely next level @#$% and would really turn some heads if animators could act out their scenes to get them to feel really lifelike,  also a layer opacity option would be really nice that or at the very least a color option for grey thats darker than the one avalible :)      ","Problem D: I really love the aplication , it's great and the most impressive animation app that I have seen , but there's a problem with it that really is bothering me, EVERY TIME that I try to zoom with my fingers, it closes the app ! So I can't really draw animations that need more precise details !      ","It is really good... I have tried many apps similar to this & it's the best of the lot. But, I am experiencing some problems with the s-pen position on screen not matching the position of the line being drawn. It happens quite randomly but often. The only way to clear it is to reload the project I'm working on. Didn't happen before I unlocked either.   Still, I'm enjoying the app. I'm sure to be throwing some stellar ideas your way to improve it, completely unaware of how much time & effort it takes to write this sort of thing      ",Can I get a refund? I am an artist and I Love drawing!  But I was disappointed that It didn't pop up on my home screen! I can't open it up either!  I already paid for the app too! Help! Please respond ASAP!!!!  I will rate 5 stars if I can get this app! Please help! I'm desperate! I'll do anything!!!!!!!!!!!!           ,"Amazing for the price! I just started using this on my Samsung Note 2 and I love everything about it! Enough functionality to make it not only fun but a useful animation tool...like a sketchbook for animation...but still simple enough to have a clean, easy to understand interface. And inexpensive. What more can you really ask from a phone app?      ",It's an okay app It can make some decent animations but it's a bit dissapointing that there are so few layers and that you can't edit the size of the canvas. It also lacks a selection tool which is also  a bit of a let down.      ,"Why?! I tried to see if it would go on youtube, but that part wont work! Unless i messed something up but still.      ",Extremely pleasant to use This app is one of the best in I've used in any category. Super simple but powerful enough to make great animations. Using the pencil feels very natural. I'm using a Galaxy Note 3 which comes with the S Pen stylus. I can't imagine it being as rewarding if you use your fingers but probably good for a bit of fun.      ,Very nice... How about ability to create true circles and other geometric shapes rather than just straight lines? Also crashes on pinch zoom.      ,"Luv it LOVE IT LOVE it LOVE IT,  been using this app frequently on my Galaxy Note 4, I have a question though: What are the best type of smart phones that I can use this app with?  I planned to upgrade my phone to an iPhone 6s,  can it work for it?  If not whats the best variety types of smart phone can supported this app? (I've messaged this to you guys earlier still no response  )      ","LOVE IT SO MUCH! I do wish it had support for sound like my old Flipnote for DS, but other than that I cannot complain. I absolutely love it and I haven't even used a stylus to draw on this yet (it must look awesome, though).      ","Best app for storyboards! Not into 2d animation but Love it for my storyboards. Can I make a suggestion, it would be awesome it there is a place where I can paste text for storyboards scripts. And maybe putting a erase all outside instead inside the eraser would be helpful. Thanks for this app!      ","Now it works! After contacting cust service, I had to re do my review. I had to uninstall and re install (you lose whatever project you had though) and works flawlessly again!      ",Like it One thing you forgot...

Just if you could add audio, this would be my favorite app ever :V      ",Needs import image sequence option... Awesome program! But do you think it would be possible to add an import png and video sequence option? You already have an export feature for these so it only makes sense.

I kept getting ""signal lost"" every time I plugged my phone in. This is for two reasons. First, turn off the signal detection. Second, I had to change the settings: Startup device to UTV007 (iSTK1160 was the default), and video format to NTSC (PAL was default).   Other thoughts: Since it's the only app I've found that actually recognizes that a camera is plugged in, I suppose the price is worth it. There is some latency. It's to be expected though. Not too bad, you can probably use this as your main monitor if you wanted to be super cheap.  It would be nice if this could record, but there are screen recording apps that can be downloaded.

Definitely not cool that you guys are blowing up social media bragging about making mothers day flipagrams and no one can do so. This is an app that people would easily pay for if it worked but judging by reviews from this weekend, you've lost a lot of customers. I too will be looking elsewhere      ","49% Really Just installed flipagram because of all the awesome talk about the app, got my mother's day photos and song all ready and it will not render past 49%...

","I was able to pick a specific start with the song I chose right down to the very second. Still able to do that now with the new update by sliding the music pane over, but it limits you to only starting your music through about 75% of the song. I wanted to start my video using about 10 seconds of the ending of a song I like but it limits me. Hard to explain, idk.      ","Locks up, won't let me save the flipagram or post. You send out notification about making mothers day flipagrams but yet the app doesn't work right to do so! I have redone  a flipagram 4 times and can't get it to 'render' past 47%. The app is junk. This is my first time using it and I just want to get this one done and delete the app so frustrating when you make a really nice flipagram for Mother's day and spend how long trying to pick out pictures etc for it not to work correctly. I have read a lot of the reviews and no one ishappy with it anymore!      ","Would like app if worked.

Please, bring back online photos, not just ""moments"" on the device ...  PS since the update I haven't made a new Flipagram, because of the above, but all the other reviews and the missing options suggest i'd be wasting my time anyway ...  UPDATE. OK, I tried to make a new Flipagram and reduced my rating to one star ... YOU RUINED IT .. just bring the old version back, PLEASE..

","Total rubbish I'm so done with this app. I've given it 2 years of trying and hoping updates would fix issues and while some things have improved (it at least keeps a video you are still creating rather than getting rid of it all if you came off the app, meaning you had to sit there for hours and do it all in one go) other things have got worse! Unbelievable!  Now I can't add a text title to my videos, process of getting music is still a joke, and I spend hours editing a video for it to not render past 50% & fail. Joke.      ",.

Lists are hard to navigate let alone the main menu. Any clickable items are ridiculously small, I can't even imagine someone with meaty fingers trying to use this app. Other than the UI being awful, it's one of the best.

Best app ever.      ,Amazing Kodi itself is awesome and I love it. Use it everyday. Functionality wise it works perfectly. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that I would like to see a more intuitive native mobile app in the future. It's kinda hard to press buttons as it's basically just a smaller version of the desktop app. But that's not worth giving a bad review for as it's still useable and works perfectly fine.      ,The confusion If I ever understood how to operate everything then I'd definitely be a huge fan.  any help? definitely from the creators      ,"Terrible mobile UI. The desktop interface has simply been shrunk and dumped on Android, making it impossible to see the tiny illegible text without a magnifying glass.

We get it, it's made by this app, you don't  have to clog out screen up with your credits. I don't see any other video editor doing that.

It would be better if was easier to adjust the pictures to show the whole thing, and the music for the length of time needs tweaking. If I have a whole song, don't cut it off and restart in 30 seconds unless I specifically shorten it to make it do that.

My backup video player is currently VLC, which is a decent player but does not come close to MX Player. That said, there is a feature in VLC that I would really like MX Player to have: Sleep timer. If this feature is added, I'll be happy to support the developers further by purchasing the Pro version.  Original review from 2014 (4 stars): I have a love-hate relationship with MX Player. It looks, works, and performs significantly better than the other half a dozen similar apps on my phone - yes, I do have 6 other players installed - but it comes up short in regards to playing certain video files. It is a pity - and it is often quite frustrating - that there is such a glaring issue, as I'd much rather use MX Player exclusively. For now, my main backup player is BSPlayer, which plays almost video file that I throw at it.

However, my recent update to Marshmallow have showed some problems. The most noticeable one is that the player would often freeze/crash when i got out from playback.

I couldn't create a playlist either. But when I play the videos directly from the storage folder it works smoothly but it's hardly the vlc media player I knew it for years.

Really like the black theme (saves my eyes). Two issues for me though: 1. Not able to skip between songs using a headset remote (including the Samsung set which came with my phone, Galaxy S6). 2. I'm not fond of the random feature in its current form. Currently the player selects a new song everytime a track is skipped instead of generating a random playlist and playing through it normally.

It plays any resolution(the quality worse than qvga to 1080p) and any format on the device. I have an Xperia C4.

It's so annoying. I will give 5 stars if you give that option. Thank you for the tip and I love the app      ,"S7 Edge, touch display does NOT work at all for me. Doesn't record touches, just the screen itself.  EDIT TO DEV REPLY 1: No. I mean when I select to show touches on screen, touches do not display when recorded.  I ended up using ilos application and it worked with minor problems, but still worked. I ended up having to manually turn OFF show screen touches, but at least when I turned on the option on the app, it turned on the option. Turning off the option required me to manually enter dev mode and turn off screen touches.  EDIT TO DEV REPLY 2: I've already found an alternative that worked  with only minor issue. Thank you for the continued support though. The support truly means more than you'd think. most companies wouldn't continue to support someone like this, even through Play Store. Thank you.  Changed from 2 star to 3 star review based on support received.      ","Add one more thing, then it'll be perfect Everything is fine in this app. It is very handy and useful.

If you guys could help me, that'd be great but until then Ill have to keep being frustrated with corrupted videos and glitches.

This app is awesome! I DL Videoshow in hopes that I could arrange my photos and videos in the order I wanted (since I was making a video time lapse for my Mom for Mother's Day)...

This app works extremely well off line, and has different versions of the Bible too.Has lots of nice features like highlighting your favorite scriptures with a diverse array of colors!  Love this app!!   ","I love Bible Offline! It is very easy to use, can pull up different translations, can pull up different languages, very good concordance to find the scriptures I am looking for at any given time. All these wonderful features are available offline! I love it!   ","Great app Doesn't act up like some apps do. The ads are annoying but they only pop up like once per day. The app is very easy to navigate, makes reading easier, and makes marking verses easy.   ",I am almost afraid to say this because every time I have an app ends up closing down but keep up the good work This is the most useful Bible offline that I have found on the market. I was having a problem finding one that did not try to direct me into what I should study and I was having a problem finding enough versions. And it was pretty annoying until I found this one. I like that it has a lot of versions and a lot of different languages so that I can  it helps to share the gospel to people who don't speak my language. Thanks and don't go anywhere. More versions please!  :)   ,"Offline is great! However, the audio is the worst. It has that robotic sound which is so hard to listen to, and annoying mind u. I love the voices of real ppl, the kind that put inflexion in the voice. Otherwise great app.   ","Good but for very insisting rate me popup User selected verse by verse comparison of different Bibles in either different colors or fonts . (if not already installed, didn't get real chance to test app- was still loading versions when rate me kept popping up after each install press) make it so you can select all the versions  you want then press install to save time.  An option to transfer app to another device without redoing downloads again or a Google sync fuction that when downloaded on another device it automatically downloads your choices.   ",Love this app! Love how easy it is to use. It's great to be able to highlight verses with different colors for different reasons. Thanks Bible Offline! Be blessed and keep honoring God.   ,"WORSHIP 24/7 This app is the best! Especially for us people who like to make excuses not to read the bible. I myself use to say I didn't have time,but this app and it's accurate Old King James version has allowed me to read my 10 chapters a day with no problem. Whether I read it all at once or in pieces I still am able to read the word on my busy  schedule. This App has DEFINITELY helped me strengthen my faith in the LORD. God bless the people who put their time and effort into making this app. HIGHLY Recommend.   ","Bible Offline They advertised the app was ""free,"" but now they are wanting me to pay. The price is not much, but, to me, it seems underhanded, and dishonest to pull such a ""bait and switch.""  I will erase it.   ","WONDERFUL AND USEFUL APP This app helps me to maintain a daily bible reading plan. Its search function is so wonderful. I can make my notes and comments as i read. It's a great app; a must have for lovers of God's word. Moreover, it comes handy when i travel to a place where there is no internet connection.   ","The app is beautifully done! Since the new update the UI looks beautifully done.When I want to read the bible on the go, this app is perfect! With night mode, the app is easy to the eyes! It has a widget that gives me a daily dose of bible quotings! Would recommend to anyone   ","The Best Offline Bible App This is the best Bible reading app I have ever used and I have tried many.  The other Bible apps left me frustrated &  disappointed because they didn't work offline or didn't function consistently.  This app works every time and it works offline.  I can take notes, bookmark and highlight with it.  I gladly paid to remove advertising and now this app is so awesome....I love this Bible app.   ","Inspiration Not only is it easy and convenient to use , it also inspires me each ad every day. #useful   ","Thanks from my heart. Love all the modern features that a great bible app needs for inspiration, study, prayer etc. and all things nice, Jesus loves yous :-)   ","First Bible application that I have used. This app is very easy to use and is excellent for studying God's word! This is the absolute sharpest sword that I have ever experienced and, it has completely cut away the evil demons that had been attached to my soul and has freed me from a lifetime of all of the torture, pain, suffering, abusement by everyone in my whole life. God and his son(my saviour) is my only family and can trust in them. They are also the only ones that truly love me!   ","THE BIBLE OFF LINE SO LOVELY May the Lord bless and strengthen you for this soul winning and inspiring work. The lazy and careless, even unbelievers have been inspired through this wonderful work and are daily giving their lives to Christ. Thanks for making this Bible comprehensive and easily accessible.   ","Upgrade is awesome I love the fact that I can now download all the versions that I want and it STAYS downloaded. I had a problem before where it would only download 1 version at a time. The audio reader sounds more human too. This app has been great since I downloaded it. It\'s even better since the upgrade. My suggestions so far is that you fix the search (sometimes it says ""No verse found"" when the word is actually there - please test) and yes the maps could include journeys other than Paul\'s.   ","Best, Sensible, Realistic, and truly GOD inspired It's a real bible. From navigation , bookmarks, font adjust, and a particular feature that's important. (The heading don't move) whilst reading.  so that you always know which book and chapter yore reading. And all the other wonderful features. Keep it up guys, and keep on trusting in the one and only, our LORD, GOD of our salvation, YESHUA, Jesus the CHRIST, whom is soon to come. Amen.   ","Can't access audible bible Purchased the audible bible on my Samsung note 3 but can't access it. When I click restore purchase it says, successfully restored, but still I can't access it. Please help   ",Excellent! Awesome App for the very nearsighted Love it!!! I can make the font as large as I need!!!!!   Awesome high contrast text with night mode and several font styles.  I'm able to tune easily for my nearsighted oddball eyeballs. Thank you so much. If I don't feel like reading the app will read it out loud to me.   ,"Excellent scripture source I use this scripture app on all m touch screen devices. It is very simple to use, you can navigate through the books, chapters and verses with relative ease. I especially like the fact that you can highlight and bookmark the verses that are pertinent to you. Very handy. I also like the fact that the app doesn't take long to load. I have recommended it to several friends.  The best scripture app for me.   ","LOVE THIS APP! I absolutely love this app! It's very easy to use and I really appreciate the fact that I can use it offline, and not use up a ton of data. I also love the fact that there are several versions of the Bible that can be  downloaded  as well.  It's really good for those who like to study the Word of God using various texts. It is such a blessing to be able to take God's Word with me every where I go. Many Blessings to you for sharing this great resource.   ","Best of the Bible apps I have tried Easy to use, can mark my passages for quickly finding later.  Can easily look up passages to keep up with sermons.      ],","Cannot sort books There is no option to sort books into an orderly fashion. This app needs a bookshelf where you can arrange the books into folders or categories. Who wants all their books, magazines, recipes, work documents, fictions, reference books all jumbled all together? No one. This is a basic feature. Please sort this.

","Only two concerns Just if google can add an offline reading support without the need to upload every book to the cloud by letting the user browse his/her local library, ALSO this annoying blue symbol that stucks on the book after it being downloaded forever...it have to be clean af instead of putting some annoying stickers.   ","Awesome I like the app, it's interface is stable and can turn PDFs to night mode(which is a big plus). The only thing I consider that is quite annoying is the fact that I have to put my credit card to download free books.   ",Still stops reading alound while the screen is locked! Defeats the whole point of it! Apparently the only reason this application has read aloud is so that developers or PM can say it is supported on the feature list.PLEASE FIX!!!!!! App stop working it says that no Internet please check connection. My internet works fine for everything else so it has to be this app. I bought book I would like to read them. They won't even upload. Not even with data pack. I even true another internet connect with no luck. Try what you said even tried removing x-memory and did not help either.

",Annoying upload and pdf viewer It's another app Google has forgotten it seems. Unfortunately there is no custom sort feature but most disappointing is the frequent downloading and uploading. I have a lot of my books on a SD card why the hell do I need to upload then re-download just to read a book. Classic Google issue of overthinking how it's apps are used by users.   ,"App isn\'t working Whenever I open the app, dialog came up on screen showing ""unfortunately Google play books has stopped"".

","Nexus7tablet Prices are getting better now, and nice to see alot more free books on my recommended, used to love this site heading back to it getting better, good work guys *****   ","Awesome but just one suggestion First off, I love reading books on my phone and I love the new night light option. But, PLEASE add a ""manual"" option for nightlight rather than always being automatically enabled only during the night. I work night shift, and when I get off work and want to read a little bit, it would be great to be able to use that function. Please consider that, thanks.   ",Best ebook reading app Have tried some others but Play Book is over all the best - reading experience and useful features. Saw some people complained and annoyed at the need for uploading book to cloud and then downloading for offline reading. This is because they do not understand and/or do not interest in the concept of being able to read the same book (and library of books) including all its settings/annotations across devices which is a really nice feather.   ,Doesn't sync I use this app on both my galaxy s6 and my tab 4 but you can't sync them together to pick up where one device left off. It's really frustrating. Thinking of switching to a different app.   ,"I love it It has become one of my favorites apps. It has a nice set of options to config, it is very reliable and it is easy to use.   ","It's good- yore not syncing It makes studying easier and highlighting with notes is an awesome idea. It isn't syncing with my phone and tablets. Please fix. Now, I'm upset. I had a part of my magazine studied and now, it's totally erased. I even had notes. What happened?   ","Read PDF from device Nice App but It looks like Google app developers unable to make reading PDF from local Drive ,unnecessary have to upload and then need to download from cloud. Is it look like user friendly?  ","I like it but I'm annoyed The app does what it's supposed to, let's you read books on your phone. But I've in countered a very annoying problem. When using orignal pages, instead of flowing text, I am unable to use page links, url links, and text selection for highlighting. If I use flowing text and highlight somthing then on original text, the highlight is no where near the text and is some were in the middle of the page (or were some were else depending on the text but it still wrong)   ",Needs a few features Please give us the option for creating folders for books. Also needs the option to change sort orders to sort books by publication date or some other custom sort.  *Update* Lowering score - too much time has passed and still no folders or advanced sort options.  :(   ,"All good..  Except one thing.. Everything is perfect except one thing.. Please add option to upload books directly from google drive mobile app.  Every time when I want to upload new book which I already have in my Drive,  either I need to go to web link of play books or download book from drive to mobile and then upload it again to playbooks which unnecessarily waste lot of time..   ","Less is more Google proves I love the clean design and simplicity of this app. Makes for a great reading experience. The only thing missing is PDF support, which I hope Google will add soon.   ","I've been using Cool Reader for years but decided to try this reader because of various crashing reasons :-) It allowed me to use volume buttons for page turns.  Very nice. However. I am losing my place mark if I want to switch from day to night, or when I set display brighter. Finally realised the settings and chapter buttons are much to close to each other. An easier (hint:some gesture)  way to get display dimmed would be appreciated. Ps. I only tried epub so far.. Update - 2015 - I have to many ebooks - management is a pain - started using Allreader   ",I can't its worst Any the ducking books I read now today its marsh fuffy I can't log in its hard work to do i went to high school today my games doesn't work. Even i play cute games my wallpapers are ainme now faster I am   ,"Awesome, but... I love the app, I think it's really easy to use, and the options you have are helpful. However, I'd like it if I could rearrange my uploads the way I want them, in MY order, not by most recent, author or anything else. I think it would be a great improvement, and kindly appreciated on my part.   ","The Night reading mode is  bit overzealous -- the screen is bright orange at night! More generally:  Play Books is pretty nice. It's great to have a consistent x-platform experience.  But why doesn't Google take advantage of owning both Google Drive and Play Books? If I have a book in GD, and upload it to PB, I now have two copies. Each has their own separate annotations and bookmarks, not to mention taking up twice the storage.   This is particularly frustrating with books on the laptop. Here I have 2 reading options: Play Books's web app VS a real ebook reader sourcing the files from my Google Drive folder. Obviously I'll use the latter (SSD+SATA access speed vs web!). So now my annotations and bookmarks are out of sync between mobile and macbook.  Furthermore, none of the clients (iOS, Android, web) allow copying text, even with unrestricted PDFs. This is a bit nuts given this is one of only 3 advantages that electronic text has over the real thing (search, portability, copy/paste). How many people read non-fiction without copying sections for notes or review?   ","Now my favorite e-reader app\U0001f496 Great clean design and is the best looking e-reader out there. Their upload feature for the cloud is amazing, which is the number one reason I'm planning to stick with this app. Different book shelves or a way to categorize books is needed. Ability to make notes and view them as popups is one of my favorite features. I love the convenience of the widgets and how beautifully designed they are. Reading aloud has improved and I am amazed at how they are able to read my uploaded content as well. \U0001f44d\U0001f44d\U0001f44d   ","Great app.  Less great policies. Storing notes and highlights on GDocs is an excellent idea.  It's easy to skim quickly through a book to find a section of interest or to get back to a section after a jump forward or back. Unfortunately G's policy on number of devices per book is very annoying.  There is a maximum of three devices per book, which seems a little tight but acceptable.  Except that it is very awkward to release a book from a device that isn't actually in your hand.  Your phone is suddenly defunct? Your tablet is at home?  Or you have more than three devices?  Yore out of luck, and can't download the book to your device in hand.

But it's still consumes memory on the internal storage for an app i never use.  Don't want it.  Why is this app mandatory?  Junk for me.   ,"Looks great and works well, but limited audio book offerings/support. Google Books looks great and works well, with plenty of content available... Combined with a decent tablet - such as the waterproof Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet (the world's thinnest and lightest tablet!) - one has the perfect medium for eBooks and eComics. It is disappointing however, that so few commercial eBooks in the Google Play Store support the ability to have the eBook read out loud... A fact which causes two stars to lost - there simply is no excuse, with modern eBook technology and modern tablets.   ","LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!!!! I love to read!!!!!
